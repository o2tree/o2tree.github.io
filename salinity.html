What is iron fertilization?

All organisms require nutrients to live and grow, and those living in the open ocean are no exception.
 Tiny phytoplankton drift on the water’s surface, converting sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into food and oxygen.
 Like other photosynthetic organisms, such as land plants, these tiny algae and cyanobacteria require nutrients for photosynthesis to occur.
 **On land, nitrogen and phosphorous are often the limiting nutrients, but in many parts of the open ocean, these nutrients are generally available.** 
 It’s other, trace nutrients that are missing, and iron is one of the key players in this system. 
Adding small amounts of iron to the ocean’s surface can trigger a bloom of phytoplankton big enough 
to be seen from space. Such additions happen naturally, such as when winds blow dust from the Sahara 
Desert or ash from a volcanic eruption. When the plume of dust or ash settles over the ocean’s surface, 
it triggers massive blooms of phytoplankton that remove substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
Iron fertilization is a Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technique that would mimic this natural system, 
artificially adding iron to the ocean’s surface to stimulate growth of phytoplankton

Limes soils are often iron deficit, even when sufficient amounts of iron are present. This is because of the generally high pH value, which leads to iron precipitation.

Seawater represents 97.5% of all water on the planet (Shannon et al., 2008). In comparison to freshwater, seawater has a higher salt (NaCl) concentration (35 g kg−1 of dissolved salts), as well as other trace compounds such as carbon, lithium, barium, manganese, iron, zinc, aluminum, copper, selenium. Seawater also contains dissolved gases, including nitrogen (N), oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Lécuyer, 2016). The high salinity of seawater limits its use in agricultural systems; however, this very property reinforces its use for microalgae cultivation.

[Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis)](https://wiki.oceanbuilders.com/books/sustainable-aquaculture/page/spirulina) is super rich in proteins - about 60% to 70% of spirulina is made up to proteins. In addition, it is rich in minerals like Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Phosphorus, Copper, Manganese, Zinc, Cobalt, Sulfur and Chromium. 

Spirulina is a good source for vitamins like β-carotene (Pro-vitamin A), Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B6, Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Niacin, Pantothenic acid, Biotin, and Folic acid.

The possibilities of utilization of seawater enriched with urea as the culture medium for a blue-green alga, Spirulina maxima, were investigated. Pretreatment by precipitation with NaHCO3 and (or) Na2CO3 was found essential to remove the excess amounts of Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in seawater prior to cultivation. A culture medium as good as the synthetic medium reported in the literature for the growth of S. maxima was obtained after treating seawater with NaHCO3 (19.2 g/L) at pH 9.2 and 35 °C for 2 h, filtering to remove precipitates, and enriching with K2HPO4 (0.5 g/L), NaNO3 (3.0 g/L), and FeSO4 (0.01 g/L). The same results were obtained by substituting a small amount (0.2 g/L or less) of either crystalline or polymerized urea for the NaNO3 in the above medium. Growth of S. maxima was inhibited at higher concentration s of urea in the culture medium. The inhibition effect was due to the partial decomposition of urea into ammonia in alkali medium. Tests conducted on the 130-L cultivation open pond also confirmed that the seawater–urea medium supports growth of S. maxima as well as the best known synthetic medium.

Several algal preservatives are available, each having its advantages and disadvantages. If in
doubt, contact the laboratory or person responsible for identifying the plankton for guidance.
The most commonly used preservative for phytoplankton is Lugol’s solution (5 to 10 percent);
however, formaldehyde (3 to 5 percent) or glutaraldehyde (2 percent) may be used.
Add approximately 0.5 to 1.0 mL of Lugol’s for every 100 mL of sample. The fixed sample will
be light brownish, the color of weak tea or brandy. Lugol’s solution is degraded by light, so both
its container and preserved water samples should be stored in dark containers or using some
other method to exclude light.

Recipe for Lugol’s Solution
Prepare Lugol’s solution by dissolving 20 g potassium iodide and 10 g iodine crystals in 200 mL
distilled water containing 20 mL glacial acetic acid.


Use a Wisconsin-style plankton net with a mesh size of 50 to 243 μm, depending on the size of organisms to be collected

Alka-Seltzer tablets contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and citric acid.

Alka-Seltzer is used to anesthetize zooplankton, not phytoplankton, making them easier to identify under a microscope by allowing
 them to expand and retain their shape, which is a common practice in plankton sample analysis for scientific studies.
 The gas produced by the Alka-Seltzer's chemical reaction of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid is thought to help the zooplankton

# The Conway medium
is a classic and widely used fertilizer formulation for growing marine microalgae in aquaculture hatcheries. 
It provides a balanced mix of major nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus) and essential trace metals and vitamins.

Unlike a single product, "Conway fertilizer" refers to a recipe. 
You can either purchase it as a pre-made kit or mix it yourself from laboratory-grade chemicals.

---

### What is Conway Medium?

It is a defined, chemical solution used to enrich seawater to create the perfect "soup" for growing specific species of microalgae (e.g., *Isochrysis*, *Chaetoceros*, *Tetraselmis*). It was developed by the renowned algal physiologist W. A. P. Conway.

### Composition of Conway Medium

The classic recipe is divided into three separate stock solutions to prevent chemicals from reacting with each other and precipitating during storage.

---
#### Solution A (Macronutrients)
*   Function: Provides the main building blocks for algal growth (Nitrogen, Phosphorus).
*   Typical Composition (per 1 liter of fresh water):
    *   Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) or Sodium Nitrate (NaNO₃): 50 - 100 g
    *   Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate (NaH₂PO₄ · 2H₂O): 5 - 10 g
*   Dosage: 1 mL of Solution A is added per 1 liter of algae culture.

----
#### Solution B (Trace Metals + Iron)
*   Function: Provides essential micronutrients, including chelated iron.
*   Typical Composition (per 1 liter of fresh water):
    *   Iron Chelate (Fe-EDTA or Fe-Citrate): 5 - 10 g (This is your bioavailable iron source)
    *   Manganese Chloride (MnCl₂ · 4H₂O): 0.5 g
    *   Boric Acid (H₃BO₃): 5 g
    *   Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO₄ · 7H₂O): 0.5 g
    *   Cobalt Nitrate (Co(NO₃)₂ · 6H₂O): 0.1 g
    *   Copper Sulfate (CuSO₄ · 5H₂O): 0.02 g
    *   Sodium Molybdate (Na₂MoO₄ · 2H₂O): 0.1 g
*   Dosage: 1 mL of Solution B is added per 1 liter of algae culture.
---
#### Solution C (Vitamins)
*   Function: Provides essential vitamins that many algae cannot synthesize themselves.
*   Typical Composition (per 1 liter of fresh water):
    *   Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin): 0.1 g
    *   Vitamin B1 (Thiamine HCl): 1.0 g
    *   Biotin: 0.01 g
*   Important: This solution is highly perishable. It must be stored in a refrigerator and made fresh every 1-2 months.
*   Dosage: 1 mL of Solution C is added per 1 liter of algae culture.

---

### How to Use Conway Medium

1.  Prepare Stock Solutions: Dissolve the chemicals for Solutions A, B, and C in separate 1-liter bottles of distilled or RO water.
2.  Sterilize (Optional but Recommended): Filter each solution through a 0.2-micron filter to prevent bacterial contamination. Solution C should not be autoclaved (heat will destroy the vitamins).
3.  Enrich the Seawater:
    *   Fill your algae culture tank with filtered and sterilized seawater.
    *   For every 1 liter of seawater, add:
        *   1 mL of Solution A
        *   1 mL of Solution B
        *   1 mL of Solution C
    *   Example: For a 100-liter culture tank, add 100 mL of each solution.
4.  Inoculate: Add your pure algae culture (the "starter") to the fertilized seawater.
5.  Aerate and Illuminate: Provide constant light and aeration to promote growth.

---

### Where to Get Conway Fertilizer Products

You have two options:

#### 1. Pre-Mixed Kits (Recommended for Beginners/Small Operations)
This is the easiest and most reliable method. You can buy convenient kits online from aquaculture supply companies. They typically provide pre-measured packets of powders to make each stock solution.

Recommended Indonesian & International Suppliers:
*   PT. Suri Tani Pemuka (Japfa Comfeed): A major Indonesian aquaculture company that likely supplies hatchery inputs.
*   Local Aquaculture Shops: Check suppliers in Batam or other major aquaculture hubs. They often import or distribute these kits.
*   International Online Retailers: Websites like AlgaeLab, BrineShrimpDirect, or AquaStock often ship internationally. Search for "Conway Medium kit" or "Algae Fertilizer kit".

#### 2. Mix Your Own (For Larger Operations
This is an advanced but crucial topic for optimizing microalgae growth. Calculating the final pH of a fertilizer mixture is complex because it involves acid-base chemistry, ion interactions,
 and the buffering capacity of seawater. However, we can establish a practical framework for managing pH in your hatchery.

### The Core Challenge

You are mixing two things:
1.  Seawater: A highly buffered solution at ~pH 8.1-8.2. Its carbonate-bicarbonate system (CO₃²⁻/HCO₃⁻) resists pH changes.
2.  Fertilizer Solutions: These are often acidic (especially the trace metal solution B).

The final pH is not a simple average. It depends on the buffering capacity of your specific seawater and the quantity and acidity of the fertilizer added.

---

### Step-by-Step Practical Guide (Instead of Pure Calculation)

For a hatchery, a practical, iterative approach is more effective than a theoretical calculation.

#### 1. The Goal pH Range
Most marine microalgae (e.g., *Chaetoceros*, *Tetraselmis*, *Isochrysis*) thrive in a pH range of 7.8 - 8.5.

#### 2. The Practical Method: Measure and Adjust

This is the most reliable method for a hatchery setting.

What you need:
*   A calibrated pH meter (essential tool).
*   A fresh batch of your filtered seawater.
*   Your stock fertilizer solutions (Conway A, B, C).

Procedure:
1.  Measure Initial pH: Take a 1-liter sample of your filtered seawater. Measure and record its pH. (e.g., pH 8.2)
2.  Add Full Fertilizer Dose: Add the standard dose of your fertilizers to the 1-liter sample (e.g., 1 mL of Solution A, 1 mL of Solution B, 1 mL of Solution C). Stir well.
3.  Measure Final pH: Wait a few minutes for the reading to stabilize, then measure the pH again. (e.g., It might drop to pH 7.9).
4.  Interpret the Result:
    *   If pH is within 7.8-8.5 (e.g., 7.9): Perfect. Proceed with inoculating your algae.
    *   If pH is too low (< 7.8): Your fertilizer mix is too acidic for your local seawater's buffering capacity.
    *   If pH is too high (> 8.5): Unlikely when adding fertilizer, but possible if your source water is unusual.

#### 3. How to Adjust the Final pH

If pH is too LOW after fertilization:
*   Solution: Dilute the Fertilizer Dose.
    *   This is the safest and most common method.
    *   Example: If adding 1 mL/L of each solution caused a larger-than-desired drop, try adding only 0.7 mL/L of Solution B (the most acidic one, containing trace metals). Keep Solutions A and C at 1 mL/L.
    *   Re-test the pH with this new ratio. Find the dose that gives you the target pH. Algae growth might be slightly slower but more stable than in a low-pH, stressful environment.

If adjustment is absolutely necessary (use cautiously):
*   To Raise pH (if too low): Use a very dilute solution of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) or Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO₃). Add dropwise to the fertilized seawater while stirring 
and monitoring the pH meter. Bicarbonate is safer and adds carbon, which algae can use.
*   To Lower pH (if too high): Use a very dilute solution of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). This is rarely needed after fertilizing.

Warning: Avoid using these strong acids/bases directly in your main culture tank. Always adjust a small sample first to determine the required amount.

---

### Understanding the "Why": The Chemistry of Conway Solutions

*   Solution A (Macronutrients): Generally near neutral pH. Has minimal impact.
*   Solution B (Trace Metals): This is the most acidic solution. The metal salts (especially Iron-EDTA) hydrolyze in water, releasing H⁺ ions and lowering the pH significantly.
*   Solution C (Vitamins): Minimal impact on pH.

### Example Workflow for a New Seawater Source

Let's say you have a new batch of seawater and a standard Conway recipe.

1.  Seawater pH = 8.2
2.  Add 1 mL/L each of A, B, C.
3.  Final pH = 7.6 *(Too low!)*
4.  Action: Create a new test liter. Add 1 mL/L of A, 0.5 mL/L of B, and 1 mL/L of C.
5.  New Final pH = 7.9 *(Acceptable!)*
6.  Conclusion: For this specific seawater batch, you will use a reduced dose of Solution B (0.5 mL per liter) to maintain optimal pH.

## [High pressure (30.40 inHg and higher) and Low Pressure (29.60 inHg or lower)  on Ocean about fish](https://wildhunter.ie/blogs/fishing-blog/effects-of-air-pressure-on-fish)

Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere in a specific area, usually measured in millibars (mb) and inches of Mercury (inHg).
 A number of factors can influence the barometric pressure in a given area, including altitude, wind patterns, and temperature.

* **A normal barometric pressure reading is typically between 29.70 inHg and 30.40 inHg**

*  when there’s low barometric pressure and less pressure on a fish’s body, the bladder expands.
   Fish may swim deeper where the water pressure is higher as a way to adjust, becoming less interested in feeding until conditions normalize.

* As we mentioned above, most agree that fishing is slow on both high-pressure and low-pressure days.** If the barometric pressure is above 30.50 inHg or below 29.60 inHg**, you might be better off waiting until the pressure normalizes.

* High Pressure (Good Weather): During periods of high atmospheric pressure, the air pressing down on the water is greater,
  slightly compressing the water. Fish with swim bladders experience a slight reduction in the organ’s volume,
  making them naturally sink a bit. To counteract this, they expend energy adjusting their position in the water column,
  which can make them less active or cautious, influencing their feeding and movement.

* Low Pressure (Bad Weather): When low-pressure systems approach, such as before a storm, the pressure exerted on the water decreases.
  This reduction causes the swim bladder to expand, making fish feel more buoyant. Fish typically respond by moving to deeper waters
  to alleviate the over-buoyancy and find stability, often decreasing their feeding activity in these moments.
  This is why anglers sometimes find it harder to catch fish before a storm.

* The waters off Changi, meanwhile, are saltier and suitable for fish that are more popular with Singapore consumers.
 They include red snapper, barramundi (Asian sea bass), golden pomfret and sea perch.

Polyculture of sea bass using tilapia as forage fish is often practiced.
Growth and survival were higher among sea bass reared with tilapia in the same
compartment than among those reared in ponds with net partition to separate
the larger prey from predator (Triño, unpublished).

The growth process of calcite or aragonite cannot start if the pH value of seawater is not adjusted to be higher than 8.0 in the basic medium. **An initial pH value of 8.2 ** is found to be enough to initiate the growth process of both calcite and aragonite seeds. Calcite seeds were found to be subjected to higher levels of supersaturation than aragonite.

Seaweed is used in a diverse range of products, from biofuel, food, healthcare, cosmetics, and even fertilizers. In 2020, Indonesia was the world’s largest producer of hydrocolloid (or jelly-like) seaweeds, producing about 66% of the world’s total. Indonesian seaweed is primarily used in the production of carrageenan, a natural gelling agent largely used in food and cosmetics.

Abalone (initial avg weight = 40.9 g) were maintained under commercial stocking conditions in flow through systems at a salinity of 35 ppt and
 fed a commercial formulated diet (Abfeed™) and fresh seaweed (Ulva lacinulata and Gracillaria gracilis).
 The stocking densities were 200 abalone m−2 and 50 sea cucumbers m−2. The sea cucumbers (initial average weight = 12.5 g) 
fed on the abalone faeces and leftover feed, which settled at the abalone tank's bottom (sludge)

The only study available on the culture of N. grammatus is that by Onomu et al. (2023) which reported the waste (faeces and leftover food) of abalone as an acceptable food to N. grammatus.
 The study also showed that N. grammatus can reduce the nitrogen, carbon and total organic matter content of waste via their feeding action. 
Thus N. grammatus was proposed as a potential IMTA candidate with abalone.

# Summary of Steps & Best Practices

1. Priority Order: Salinity First -> Then pH.
2. Salinity Change: Raise salinity gradually over 4-5 days using daily partial water changes with pre-mixed 32 ppt saltwater. Do not exceed a 5 ppt increase per day.
3. Stabilize: Once at 32 ppt, let the system rest for 1-2 days.
4. pH Change - Step 1: Increase aeration and surface agitation dramatically. Re-test pH after 24 hours.
5. pH Change - Step 2: Test your KH (Carbonate Hardness). If it's low (<8 dKH), use a commercial marine buffer to raise it slowly, following the product's instructions.
6. Test, Test, Test: Use calibrated and reliable test equipment throughout the entire process. Never add chemicals based on guesswork.
7. Monitor Livestock: Watch your fish and invertebrates closely for signs of stress (rapid breathing, lethargy, loss of color) during the process. If you see stress, pause and proceed more slowly.

By following this methodical approach, you will safely and effectively achieve your target water parameters.
  
Magnesium hydroxide is another compound used in water chemistry, and it's an excellent follow-up question in the context of raising pH.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of magnesium hydroxide in aquarium use and how it compares to calcium hydroxide.

What is Magnesium Hydroxide?

· Chemical Formula: Mg(OH)₂
· Common Forms:
  · Pharmaceutical Grade: Sold as a liquid antacid under names like "Milk of Magnesia." This form is pure and safe for aquarium use if it contains no additives (e.g., flavorings, sodium).
  · Powdered Form: A fine white powder, often used in water treatment.
· How it Works: Like calcium hydroxide, it is a strong base. When added to water, it dissociates and releases hydroxide ions (OH⁻), which directly neutralize acid (H⁺ ions), thereby raising the pH.

Comparison: Magnesium Hydroxide vs. Calcium Hydroxide (Kalkwasser)

While both raise pH, they have critical differences that affect their use in aquariums.

Feature Magnesium Hydroxide (Mg(OH)₂) Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂ - Kalkwasser)
Solubility Extremely Low (~0.00064 g/100mL) Very Low (~0.173 g/100mL)
Relative Strength Weaker base. Raises pH more slowly and gradually. Stronger base. Raises pH more quickly and potently.
Primary Aquarium Use 1. Raising pH gently. 2. Supplementing Magnesium. 1. Raising and maintaining pH. 2. Supplementing Calcium and Alkalinity.
What it Adds Magnesium (Mg²⁺) and Hydroxide (OH⁻) Calcium (Ca²⁺) and Hydroxide (OH⁻)
Reaction Speed Very Slow. Due to its extremely low solubility, it acts as a sustained, slow-release source of hydroxide. Fast (relative to Mg(OH)₂). Its higher solubility means it affects water chemistry more immediately.

Key Implications for Your Aquarium:

1. Slower, Gentler pH Rise: Because of its extremely low solubility, magnesium hydroxide is less likely to cause a dangerous rapid pH spike compared to calcium hydroxide. This can make it seem "safer," but it also makes it much less effective for actively raising pH in a meaningful time frame.
2. It Adds Magnesium, Not Calcium: This is its most important function in reef aquaria. In a marine system, high calcium and alkalinity levels can cause calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) to precipitate out of the water uncontrollably. Magnesium inhibits this precipitation. Therefore, magnesium is a crucial element that must be maintained (~1250-1350 ppm) to keep calcium and alkalinity stable.
3. Not a Primary Buffer: Magnesium hydroxide is not an efficient way to boost carbonate hardness (KH). While it raises pH, it doesn't directly add carbonates or bicarbonates (the KH buffer). Your KH level would remain unchanged, meaning the pH rise could be unstable without adequate buffering capacity.

How to Use Magnesium Hydroxide Safely (If You Choose To)

If you want to use it for a gentle pH nudge, you must use a pure, additive-free product.

Procedure:

1. Source: Use only pure, unscented, unflavored Milk of Magnesia (check the ingredients list: it should only contain water and magnesium hydroxide) or a reputable aquarium-brand magnesium supplement.
2. Dilute: Mix a small amount thoroughly in a cup of RO/DI water.
3. Dose Slowly: Add the diluted solution to an area of high water flow in your sump or tank over a period of time.
4. Monitor: Test pH frequently during dosing to avoid raising it too quickly. Even though it's slow, overdoing it is still possible.

Conclusion and Recommendation for Your Goal

For your goal of going from pH 7.3 to 8.2 in a brackish/marine system:

· Magnesium hydroxide is not the right tool for this job. Its extremely low solubility makes it impractical to achieve a significant pH shift in a reasonable amount of time. You would need to add a very large amount.
· Stick to the previous plan. The hierarchy of solutions remains:
  1. Address Salinity First.
  2. Maximize Aeration to drive off CO₂. This is often the primary cause of low pH.
  3. Test and Raise Carbonate Hardness (KH). This is the most effective and stable method. Use a marine buffer to raise your KH to 8-12 dKH. This will naturally and reliably raise your pH to 8.2-8.

3 and lock it in place.
  4. Calcium Hydroxide (Kalkwasser) is a more appropriate active dosing method than magnesium hydroxide if you need to combat consistently low pH after steps 1-3, especially in a reef tank with high calcium demand.

In summary: Think of magnesium hydroxide primarily as a magnesium supplement for marine tanks, not as a primary pH-raising agent. For your purpose, boosting KH with a buffer is the simplest, most predictable, and safest method.
