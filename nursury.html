A sea pen (keramba tancab)  is a type of fish-farming enclosure that uses a stationary, fixed-bottom,
 or bottomless net to hold fish, allowing water to flow through it. It is distinct from a sea cage, which is a totally enclosed,
 floating structure that is not anchored to the seafloor. Sea pens are larger than cages, stationary, and less intensive but less mobile than cages.

# Seagrass

Seagrasses are known as the "lungs of the sea" because one square meter of seagrass can generate 10 liters of oxygen every day through photosynthesis.
 Seagrass leaves also absorb nutrients and slow the flow of water, capturing sand, dirt and silt particles.

In recent years, seagrass has been held in higher regard globally due to its ability to store carbon in the soil. The submerged plant can soak carbon up to 40 times 
more effectively than forests and store up to 18 per cent of oceanic carbon.

But more than 45 per cent of Singapore’s original seagrass cover has been lost to coastal development and reclamation over the last five decades.
These underwater fields are nurseries for juvenile fish, while serving as habitats for sea stars, seahorses, crabs and sea cucumbers, among other marine life. 
For example, conventional methods include taking a sand core containing some seagrass and transplanting it at another site. However,
 Singapore’s waters can be turbid, with some areas experiencing stronger currents, affecting 
the sediment’s stability and causing transplanted seagrass to be washed away.

To address this, scientists will use biodegradable mats made of calcium carbonate and coconut fibre to anchor 
transplanted species and stabilise the sediment.
Another method involves sowing seeds into the sand, which is cost-effective and easier to scale up. But as the seed production of local seagrass species is not well known, researchers will do aquarium experiments to trigger the flowering of seagrass species.

  How to keep rotifers alive?
You can store live rotifers for one week in the refrigerator.
Just give them a little algae every other day.
Some people do indeed freeze rotifers and feed them out to their corals.
Just make sure they don't get freezer burn!


The life span of rotifers has been estimated to be between 3.4 to 4.4 days at 25°C.
Generally, the larvae become adult after 0.5 to 1.5 days and females thereafter start to lay eggs approximately every four hours.
It is believed that females can produce ten generations of offspring before they eventually die.

Facing starvation, some rotifers could even extend their life span; young Brachionus plicatilis suppressed reproduction
and about half of them survived for more than 16 days without any food, while the fed controls reproduced normally and
lived about 12 days (Yoshinaga, Hagiwara & Tsukamoto 2003a).

Can rotifers become dormant?
Like tardigrades, bdelloid rotifers have the ability to enter a dormant state called cryptobiosis,
or more specifically, anhydrobiosis. In this state, they can survive desiccation,
meaning the complete loss of water from their body, for long periods of time.

[Collecting rotifers](https://evidentscientific.com/en/insights/rotifers-an-introduction-to-the-microscopic-world-of-wheel-animals#:~:text=Like%20tardigrades%2C%20bdelloid%20rotifers%20have,for%20long%20periods%20of%20time.)


Kedalaman Air: Kedalaman perairan ideal untuk teripang bervariasi antara 1 hingga 3 meter, tergantung pada spesies yang dibudidayakan. Teripang pasir biasanya lebih cocok pada kedalaman 2 meter, sementara teripang gamat dapat hidup di perairan yang sedikit lebih dangkal.


Mysis Shrimp are nutritionally whole or balanced and provide your fish with plenty of protein, a little fat, and some vitamins and minerals. Brine Shrimp, on the other hand, is like a bag of chips or a handful of french fries. They taste great but really don't provide all that much nutrition by themselves

- Mature size:  
  - *Holothuria scabra*: ≥20 cm, 300–500 g.  
  - *Holothuria atra*: ≥25 cm, 400–600 g.  

### 🌡 Conditioning Process  
- Acclimatize in tanks (salinity/temperature matching wild habitat).  
- Feed natural diet:  
  - Seaweed powder (30% protein).  
  - Microalgae (*Navicula*, *Chaetoceros*).  
- Thermal shock method for spawning induction:  
  - Raise temp to 32°C for 1 hr, then return to 28°C.  

---

## 3. Spawning & Fertilization  
### ⚡ Induced Spawning Techniques  
1. Temperature Shock (Most common)  
   - Expose to 5°C above ambient for 30–60 mins.  
2. Drying + Sunlight Exposure  
   - Keep broodstock dry for 30 mins, then return to water.  
3. Gonad Stimulation (Experimental)  
   - Serotonin injection (1–2 µg/g body weight).  

### 🥚 Egg Collection & Fertilization  
- Eggs: 100,000–500,000 per female.  
- Sperm: Dilute in seawater before mixing with eggs.  
- Fertilization rate: 70–90% under optimal conditions.  

---

## 4. Larval Rearing (Auricularia → Pentactula)  
| Stage | Duration | Feed | Key Requirements |  
|-------|---------|------|-----------------|  
| Auricularia | 8–12 days | Microalgae (*Chaetoceros*, *Isochrysis*) | Gentle aeration, 28°C |  
| Doliolaria | 3–5 days | Mixed algae + yeast | Reduced light |  
| Pentactula | 5–7 days | Benthic diatoms (*Navicula*) | Settlement substrates |  

Water Quality:  
- pH: 7.8–8.3  
- Ammonia: <0.1 ppm  
- DO: >5 mg/L  

- < 3gr does not need sand Not deposit feeder
- In the wild, juveniles (∼9 mm) settle on seagrass leaves as grazers (Mercier et al., 2000a), and once larger, they migrate onto sand where they become deposit-feeders (Mercier et al., 2000b). 
- need different sand size for optimum grow
- can not replace with silica sand
- Sandfish as Deposit Feeders: Sandfish (Holothuria scabra) are a type of sea cucumber that are deposit feeders. This means they eat organic matter, bacteria, microalgae, and other small organisms that live within the sediment (sand) on the seafloor. The sand itself acts as a substrate and a food source, but the nutritional value comes from the living things within it.
- Sargassum as a Fertilizer: Sargassum is a type of seaweed that is rich in nutrients and organic matter. When added to the sandy substrate in sandfish cultivation tanks or ponds, it acts as an organic fertilizer. This enrichment of the sand boosts the growth of the microalgae, bacteria, and other microorganisms that the sandfish feed on. Studies have shown that adding dried sargassum to the sediment can significantly increase the food abundance, leading to faster growth rates for juvenile sandfish.
- Sargassum as a Direct Feed: In addition to fertilizing the sand, sargassum can also be processed into a direct supplemental feed for sandfish. Researchers have tested different preparations, such as fermented sargassum and powdered sargassum, and found that they can improve the growth and survival of sandfish, especially in early juvenile stages. Fermented sargassum, in particular, has been shown to be very effective.
-  In summary, sargassum doesn't directly fertilize the sand in the way you might think of a plant fertilizer, but it enriches the organic content of the sand, which in turn acts as a "fertilizer" for the living organisms that the sandfish consume. It can also be a direct and valuable feed source for the sandfish themselves. This use of sargassum is a promising development for sustainable aquaculture and a way to utilize
he large influxes of sargassum that can be a nuisance in coastal areas.

Chlorella vulgaris Powder

- Chlorella vulgaris is a type of microalgae known for its high nutritional value, containing protein, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. While live microalgae are a traditional feed for sandfish larvae and early juveniles in hatcheries, powdered forms like chlorella vulgaris are being explored as a cost-effective alternative.

Usage and Benefits
Supplement to Live Algae: Powdered microalgae can supplement or even replace live microalgae, reducing the high cost and labor associated with maintaining live cultures.

Nutritional Profile: Chlorella is rich in essential amino acids and fatty acids, which are crucial for the growth and health of sandfish. Its high protein content makes it an excellent addition to a sandfish diet.

Improved Growth: Studies on other aquatic species have shown that including Chlorella vulgaris in the diet can enhance growth performance and feed efficiency. This is a promising area for further research in sandfish grow-out.

In summary, both sargassum and chlorella vulgaris powder are valuable feed ingredients for sandfish aquaculture. Sargassum is a well-established and highly effective component, especially when fermented, while chlorella powder is a promising, nutrient-rich supplement that can reduce reliance on expensive live feeds.

When transporting *Penaeus vannamei* (Pacific white shrimp),
 the requirements for Post Larva 15 (PL15) and Post Larva 10 (PL10) differ mainly in terms of density, water quality, oxygen demand, and stress sensitivity due to their developmental stages.
 Below is a comparison:

### 1. Size & Development Stage
- PL10: Younger, smaller (≈ 10 days post-metamorphosis), more delicate, higher mortality risk.
- PL15: Older, larger (≈ 15 days post-metamorphosis), more robust, better stress tolerance.

### 2. Transport Density (Per Bag/Liter)
- PL10: Higher density possible (e.g., **5,000–10,000 PL10/L**) due to smaller size.
- PL15: Lower density (e.g., **3,000–5,000 PL15/L**) due to larger size & higher oxygen demand.

### 3. Oxygen Requirements
- PL10: Lower absolute oxygen demand but more sensitive to hypoxia.
- PL15: Higher oxygen consumption per individual but more resilient to fluctuations.

### 4. Water Quality Sensitivity
- PL10: More sensitive to ammonia, temperature swings, and salinity changes.
- PL15: Hardier, tolerates slight variations better.

### 5. Temperature & Salinity
- Both require 26–30°C and salinity 25–35 ppt, but:
  - PL10: Needs stricter stability.
  - PL15: Can handle minor deviations.

### 6. Stress Management
- PL10: More prone to stress; may need additives (e.g., **buffers, probiotics**).
- PL15: Handles transport stress better; fewer additives needed.

### 7. Transport Duration
- PL10: Best for shorter hauls (<6–8 hrs).
- PL15: Can endure longer transport (up to 12–24 hrs) with proper aeration.

### Key Takeaways
- PL10: Higher density possible but needs more careful monitoring of water quality.
- PL15: Lower density but hardier for long-distance transport.
- For both: Use oxygen-filled bags, temperature control, and minimal stress handling.

Would you like specific protocols for packing or acclimation?


Here’s a step-by-step protocol for packing and transporting PL10 vs. PL15 *Litopenaeus vannamei*, including acclimation procedures to ensure high survival rates.  

---

### 1. Pre-Transport Preparation  
#### A. Water Quality Adjustment  
- Salinity: Match transport water to the source farm’s salinity (± 2 ppt).  
- Temperature: Gradually adjust to 26–28°C (avoid sudden changes).  
- pH: Maintain 7.8–8.2 (use buffering agents if needed).  
- Ammonia/Nitrite: Must be <0.1 ppm (use zeolite or probiotics if high).  

#### B. Starvation  
- PL10: Stop feeding 6–8 hrs before packing (gut clearance).  
- PL15: Stop feeding 8–12 hrs before packing (larger body size = longer clearance time).  

---

### 2. Packing Protocol  
#### A. Bag Specifications  
- Use oxygen-filled polyethylene bags (thickness ≥ 0.8 mm).  
- Fill 1/3 with water, 2/3 pure oxygen (O₂).  
- Add 2–5 g/L of activated charcoal (for ammonia control).  

#### B. Stocking Density  
| Stage  | Bag Size (L) | Density (PL/L) | Max Transport Time |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| PL10 | 10–15      | 5,000–10,000  | 6–8 hrs       |
| PL15 | 10–15      | 3,000–5,000   | 12–24 hrs     |  

Note:  
- Reduce density by 20–30% if transport exceeds 12 hrs.  
- For air transport, decrease density further (PL10: 4,000–6,000/L, PL15: **2,000–3,000/L**).  

#### C. Additives (Optional but Recommended)  
- Stress Coat: 1–2 ppm (e.g., **aloe vera extract**).  
- Probiotics: *Bacillus spp.* (1–2 ppm) to reduce ammonia.  
- Antifungal/Mild Sedative: For long hauls (e.g., 2–5 ppm clove oil for PL15 only).  

---

### 3. Transport Conditions  
- Temperature: Maintain 26–28°C (use cooling boxes or **insulated containers**).  
- Oxygen Monitoring: Ensure O₂ > 5 ppm (use oxygen tablets if needed).  
- Avoid Light & Vibration: Keep bags in dark, stable conditions.  

---

### 4. Post-Transport Acclimation  
#### A. Floating for Temperature Adjustment  
- Float unopened bags in destination pond for 15–30 mins to equalize temperature.  

#### B. Gradual Salinity Mixing (If Needed)  
- Step 1: Open bag, add small amounts of pond water every 5 mins for 30–45 mins.  
- Step 2: Release PLs gently near aerated areas.  

#### C. Post-Release Care  
- PL10: Feed immediately with high-protein diet (e.g., *Artemia*).  
- PL15: Can wait 2–3 hrs before feeding (more resilient).

If PLs arrive weak or stressed:  
1. Gradual Acclimation:  
   - Float bags for 45–60 mins (not 30 mins).  
   - Drip-acclimate with pond water over 1–2 hrs.  
2. Revival Additives:  
   - PL10: 5 ppm glucose + 1 ppm vitamin B12.  
   - PL15: 3 ppm calcium magnesium + probiotics.  
3. Post-Release Care:  
   - PL10: Hold in nursery tanks (1–2 days) before pond release.  
   - PL15: Can be released directly but avoid feeding for 4–6 hrs.  

---

### Final Recommendations by Condition  
| Transport Type | Best for PL10? | Best for PL15? |  
|---------------|---------------|---------------|  
| Air Freight | Only if <6 hrs | Preferred (more resilient) |  
| Hot Climate | Avoid if possible | Use with cooling packs |  
| Long Road Haul | Not recommended | Yes (with O₂ support) |  

For highest survival:  
- PL10: Keep transport <8 hrs, avoid extreme temps.  
- PL15: More flexible but monitor O₂ closely.

# Vannamei highlist
Highlights
* Clear differences in feeding behaviour between male and female Litopenaeus vannamei.
* Males arrived to the feeding tray(size tray: 60cm x 60cm or 100cm x 100cm) faster and fed for longer than females.
* Females exhibited greater levels of inactivity and more signs of stress than males.
* These behavioural differences are important when choosing mono- vs mixed-sex culture.

## Rotifer
Copepods and rotifers are both types of small aquatic organisms, particularly important in marine and freshwater ecosystems
 as they are a food source for many fish and other invertebrates. However, they belong to 
different groups: copepods are crustaceans (Arthropoda), while rotifers are rotifers (Rotifera).
Copepods are more common in reef tanks, where they contribute to the tank's overall biodiversity
and can be cultured. Rotifers, on the other hand, often require specific conditions
and are typically cultured separately, but they can be a valuable food source, especially for corals. 

Copepods:
Classification: Crustaceans (Arthropoda). 
Habitat: Often associated with live rocks in reef tanks. 
Diet: Primarily feed on phytoplankton, contributing to nutrient cycling in the tank. 
Reef Tank Role: Provide biodiversity, contribute to nutrient cycling, and serve as a food source for certain fish and invertebrates. 
Cultures: Can be cultured in refugiums or other dedicated systems. 

Rotifers:
Classification: Rotifers (Rotifera). 
Habitat: Found in freshwater environments, including lakes, ponds, and even temporary puddles. 
Diet: Primarily feed on algae and other small organisms. 
Reef Tank Role: Serve as a food source, especially for corals and larval fish. 
Cultures: Typically cultured in separate tanks, often using algae or specialized feed.

## [High pressure (30.40 inHg and higher) and Low Pressure (29.60 inHg or lower)  on Ocean about fish](https://wildhunter.ie/blogs/fishing-blog/effects-of-air-pressure-on-fish)

Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere in a specific area, usually measured in millibars (mb) and inches of Mercury (inHg).
 A number of factors can influence the barometric pressure in a given area, including altitude, wind patterns, and temperature.

* **A normal barometric pressure reading is typically between 29.70 inHg and 30.40 inHg**

*  when there’s low barometric pressure and less pressure on a fish’s body, the bladder expands.
   Fish may swim deeper where the water pressure is higher as a way to adjust, becoming less interested in feeding until conditions normalize.

* As we mentioned above, most agree that fishing is slow on both high-pressure and low-pressure days.** If the barometric pressure is above 30.50 inHg or below 29.60 inHg**, you might be better off waiting until the pressure normalizes.

* High Pressure (Good Weather): During periods of high atmospheric pressure, the air pressing down on the water is greater,
  slightly compressing the water. Fish with swim bladders experience a slight reduction in the organ’s volume,
  making them naturally sink a bit. To counteract this, they expend energy adjusting their position in the water column,
  which can make them less active or cautious, influencing their feeding and movement.

* Low Pressure (Bad Weather): When low-pressure systems approach, such as before a storm, the pressure exerted on the water decreases.
  This reduction causes the swim bladder to expand, making fish feel more buoyant. Fish typically respond by moving to deeper waters
  to alleviate the over-buoyancy and find stability, often decreasing their feeding activity in these moments.
  This is why anglers sometimes find it harder to catch fish before a storm.

* The waters around Lim Chu Kang are “more brackish” and suitable for rearing milk fish and grey mullet,
 and he is currently the biggest producer of both types of fish in Singapore.

* The waters off Changi, meanwhile, are saltier and suitable for fish that are more popular with Singapore consumers.
 They include red snapper, barramundi (Asian sea bass), golden pomfret and sea perch.

Polyculture of sea bass using tilapia as forage fish is often practiced.
Growth and survival were higher among sea bass reared with tilapia in the same
compartment than among those reared in ponds with net partition to separate
the larger prey from predator (Triño, unpublished).

## Sebass vs Snapper
- diffferent
- which one taste better

|The table below provides a quick comparison of the availability and cost of snapper and grouper:|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


|Fish|	Availability|	Cost|
|----|--------------|--------|
|Snapper|	Common in Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean|	Higher price due to demand and difficulty of catching|
|Grouper|	Common in Atlantic and Pacific oceans|	More affordable due to abundance and ease of catching|

## Snapper vs Grouper
Both of these species are known for having firm yet moist meat while having the added health benefit of being low in fat. Snapper is slightly sweeter and the meat more delicate, especially when grilled, than Grouper. Most compare its flavor and texture to be similar to that of halibut or sea bass. Grouper on the other hand is milder or more subtle in flavor making it perfect for absorbing either dressings or marinades

## hardshell vs softshell  (or just molting shrimp) result in high and low salinity shirmp culture
Hard shell lobsters also have less water weight, while soft
shell lobsters contain more water. This difference in yield is
reflected in the lower pricing of soft shell lobsters. For comparison, the average
yield for hard shells is roughly 20% to 28% meat, while soft shells contain around 15% to
20% meat. 5 Jun 2018

* Grouper culture has three phases:
	1. the larval stage where fish is reared for 15-60 days, 
	2.  the nursery stage where fish is cultured for 1-2 months, and 
	3. the growout stage where fish is reared for 6-8 months.
   
	Grouper need to be sorted and size-graded every week to prevent cannibalism. Other routine procedures 
   include feeding, net maintenance, stock sampling, and monitoring water quality

*  Hatchery phase
	1. Stock 20-30 larvae/liter in 3-25 tons rearing tanks
	2. Feed larvae Nannochlorum, rotifer, Artemia, and articial diet
	3. Transfer larvae to marine cages when larvae reach the total length of 2-3 cm (15-60 days)
* Nursery phase
	1. Stock 2-3 cm fry in 1 x 2 x 1.5 m hapa nets at 75-100 fry/m3
	set inside floating net cages. Uniform fry size should be strictly observed during stocking.
	2. Install hover-type lamp to attract grouper prey such as copepods, mysids, young fishes, and crustacean larvae
	3. Feed fry artificial diet or finely chopped frozen or fresh low value fish 4-6 times a day
	4. Transfer fry to grow-out cages or ponds after 45-60 days or when total length is 6-10cm

💡 The Two Types of Cannibalism

Researchers typically categorize cannibalism in cultured fish into two main types, which are relevant for grouper fry:

- Type I (Early Larval Cannibalism): This occurs in the larval phase and is not necessarily dependent on size differences. The cannibal attacks and damages part of a sibling (often the tail) but cannot swallow the victim whole, so the rest is disgorged. This can cause mortality and infections.
- Type II (Late Juvenile or Adult Cannibalism): This form is directly linked to size variation within a group. A larger fish (cannibal) swallows a smaller sibling whole. This type often leads to more severe stock losses than Type I.

� Lighting Conditions and Cannibalism in Fish

While the search results confirm that light intensity is an environmental factor studied for cannibalism mitigation, the specific research pertains to other species.

- Evidence from Other Species: One study on Asian Seabass (Lates calcarifer) found that light intensity significantly affected survival, growth, and cannibalism rates. The study concluded that an intensity of 500-1000 lx was optimal for survival and growth in that species.
- Information Gap on Grouper: The provided research on grouper fry focuses on other factors like stocking density and feeding frequency. The search results do not contain a specific study that directly addresses the use of lighting to control cannibalism in grouper fry.

🎣 Proven Mitigation Strategies for Grouper Fry

For grouper fry, the most well-documented methods to reduce cannibalism involve stocking density, feeding frequency, and size-grading.

- Optimal Stocking Density and Feeding: A 2025 study on hybrid groupers found that a stocking density of 30–40 fish/L combined with a feeding frequency of 4–6 times per day significantly reduced cannibalism. In contrast, lower densities and less frequent feeding increased it.
- Size-Grading: Since Type II cannibalism is driven by size differences, routine grading by size is the most common method to reduce losses. By separating larger potential cannibals from smaller potential prey, farmers can effectively manage this risk. Morphometric models can even predict the length ratio at which cannibalism becomes possible, allowing for proactive grading.

* **small prawn eats the grouper lice but not too big which grouper will eat the prawn**

* A freshwater dip is a treatment for saltwater fish, like groupers, to help remove parasites.
 It involves temporarily placing the fish in fresh water for a short period, typically 3-5 minutes, to kill or loosen parasites.
 This is a pre-quarantine treatment and should not be relied upon as the sole treatment for a disease.

Weak fish:
Avoid freshwater dips on fish that are already weak or dying, as they can be fatal. 

Potential side effects:
Some fish may have difficulty returning to their normal salinity after a freshwater dip, and may need assistance to regain their balance. 

Aeration:
Ensure the freshwater dip container has adequate aeration to provide oxygen to the fish

# Minyak cengkeh
Efektivitas Pemberian Minyak Cengkeh sebagai Obat Bius pada Ikan Kerapu Cantang

Penelitian penggunaan minyak cengkeh dengan konsentrasi 5, 10 dan 15 ppm sebagai bahan anastesi pada transportasi tertutup ikan Kerapu cantang memberikan hasil tingkat kelangsungan hidup sebesar 76,67%, 86,67%, dan 80%, sedangkan tanpa penambahan minyak cengkeh tingkat kelangsungan hidup ikan kerapu adalah 60% pada pada transportasi dengan pemberian MS 222 70 ppm tingkat kelangsungan hidup mencapai 90%.
Minyak cengkeh merupakan salah satu obat bius alami yang telah dikembangkan dan digunakan sebagai pengganti obat bius kimia seperti MS 222.
Minyak cengkeh diperoleh dari ekstrak daun, batang dan bunga tanaman cengkeh. Minyak cengkeh diketahui mengandung senyawa eugenol yang bersifat
analgesik atau mengurangi rasa sakit, selain itu juga mengandung senyawa kartiofilin yang bersifat sebagai antiseptik. Minyak cengkeh digunakan sebagai anestesi lokal pada hewan dan manusia dan memiliki efek sedasi pada hewan air. Namun senyawa tersebut juga memiliki aktivitas insektisida sehingga jika digunakan secara berlebihan dapat menyebabkan kematian pada ikan.

Pemberian anestesi minyak cengkeh juga mempengaruhi total leukosit pada ikan kerapu setelah transportasi selama 10 jam.
 Pada penelitian ini jumlah leukosit mengalami perbedaan bermakna antara perlakuan negatif dan kontrol.
 Leukosit merupakan salah satu bagian darah yang berfungsi sebagai antibodi non spesifik. Saat ikan mengalami kondisi stres, 
jumlah leukosit dapat meningkat sebagai bentuk tindakan pertahanan akibat stresor.

# [sandfish](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352513424000334)

Grow-out operations in central Vietnam are capable of producing market-size sandfish (350–400 g), from 2–5 g juveniles, after approximately 12 months in earthen pond-based culture.
 However, the onset of the wet season in Vietnam (typically from May to early November) and resulting reduction in the salinity of culture water,
 may impact productivity through reduced growth rates and survival (Mills et al., 2012).
 Vietnamese farmers have consequently developed an ‘advanced nursery’ phase, where 2–5 g juveniles are cultured at high density in ponds with organic matter-rich sediment (>50,000 ind./ha compared
 to ∼10,000 ind./ha which is the standard grow-out density), until they reach a size of ca. 50 g.
 This permits ‘short-cropping’ during the grow-out phase, because when larger juveniles are grown out, they can reach the target harvest weight of 350–400 g within 7–9 months
 and experience higher rates of survival (Mills et al., 2012).

The goal of this study was therefore to undertake a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of supplemental feeding to support short-cropping culture of sandfish in Vietnam by:

1. evaluating the growth and survival performance of sandfish juveniles offered two different types of locally-sourced seaweed-based supplemental feeds (Sargassum sp. and Gracilaria verrucosa) 
processed by both fermentation and pulverisation;

2.  determining an optimal stocking density for juveniles offered supplemental feeding; and 

3. applying the best-performing supplemental feed, determined from (1) during large-scale earthen-pond culture to assess the feasibility of commercial-scale short cropping.

Supplemental feed preparation
===
Supplemental feeds were prepared from commercially available wild-sourced seaweed collected from coastal regions in Khánh Hòa Province, Vietnam, which is readily available in dried form (Hong and Ha, 2022). Fresh seaweed is first cleaned at the collection site using seawater to remove sand, debris, epiphytic growths and other extraneous matter attached to thalli and, prior to sun-drying, was rinsed with freshwater to remove salt residue. Both species of dried seaweed were powdered to a particle size of 350–450 µm using a high-speed dry grinding machine (2 kg capacity; 4000 W; model RRH2000A; Riri Hong Ltd) to produce the pulverised supplemental feeds. The fermented diets were prepared in batches as required. To prepare a single batch of fermented feed, 10 kg of dried seaweed powder was mixed with 2.5 g of a commercially-available livestock feed probiotic mixture (BIO-MEN animal feed brewing yeast/Men ủ thức ăn chăn nuôi BIO-MEN manufactured by Vườn Sinh Thái/Eco Garden, Vietnam), and 10 L of freshwater. The probiotic mixture comprised Saccharomyces boulardii (at a concentration of 1010-1014 Colony Forming Units; CFU), Lactobacillus acidophilus (1010 CFU) and Bacillus subtilis (1010 CFU) per g, respectively. This product had a maximum moisture content of 10%, sand/grit content of 2% and used corn flour and rice bran as the probiotic carrier agents (https://vuonsinhthai.com.vn/men-u-vi-sinh-thao-duoc-u-chin-thuc-an-chan-nuoi.html
).

 # use of oyster shell 
 The easiest way to avoid this problem is to only use aged shell in your setting tanks. Every shell used in the system should be aged
at least a full year out in the open where it will be is exposed to weather and other factors that will remove the organic material from the shells. Once this ageing process
is completed, it is best if the shells are washed or cleaned to remove as much dirt and small shell fragments from the cultch as possible. When you have clean cultch material
 it is ready to be containerized for use in your setting system.
 
 ## Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) 
 is a non-crystalline form of calcium carbonate, and it is composed of aggregated nano-size primary particles. 
 Here, we evaluated its anti-cancer effect postulated relative to its buffering capabilities in lung cancer.
 
 # Aeration 
 The most common approach is to use aeration. Most setting tanks are fairly shallow (6 feet deep or less) and this lends itself to aeration by rotary blower. Rotary blowers are used 
 because they provide high volumes of air at low pressure. They are more efficient than compressors and do not introduce oil into the system. 
Blowers should be sized to provide a gentle rolling movement throughout the entire setting tank. When installing aeration, make sure that water from the setting tanks is 
not allowed by gravity to flow backwards into the blower when the blower is off.
The easiest ways to do this are either to install the blower above the highest water level of the setting tanks or to add a section of pipe that extends above the high water mark.
Getting air from the blower to the tanks is usually done through PVC pipes. Pipes
should be sized according to the volume of the setting tanks but, with smaller tanks
capable of holding 200-300 shell bags, 1.5 to 2 inch inside diameter pipes are
sufficient. Larger tanks will require larger diameter aeration lines. Blowers used in
remote setting do not create much pressure and therefore the use of larger pipe is
required. Pipes should be drilled with 3/8” holes about every 8 to 12 inches along
the length of the pipe to provide adequate aeration. Aeration pipes should be spaced
apart to allow a gentle flow to be created when the air is on. For example, a 12 foot
diameter tank with 3 or 4 pipes spaced at the bottom of the tank provides sufficient
aeration for good settlement to occur.

It is important that aeration pipes used inside the tanks NOT be glued together. These pipes will fill with sediment, have oyster larvae settle on them, and other things that
require them to be cleaned inside and out. In fact, each time a setting tank is broken down and reloaded with cultch, the air pipes should
be taken apart and thoroughly cleaned inside and out. This can be done with a brush on a
rope and fresh water, another good reason to use larger diameter piping. Care should be  taken to remove ALL newly settled oyster spat
from the pipes and any other surface in the setting tank. If the tanks are re-used these spat will continue to grow. These spat
are voracious feeders and will compete with the next batch of larval oysters for the food in the tank and as they get bigger will provide substrate for oysters to settle on 

# Instant algae
Instant algae is your easy solution for replacing or supplementing live microalgae in commercial fish, shrimp, shellfish and ornamental hatcheries, universities and research centers. It is real marine microalgae, grown under laboratory conditions and concentrated for easy storage and long life. Instant algae is not alive and cannot be used as starter cultures – it is an inexpensive bulk feed.

Nannochloropsis

These are small green algaes that are extensively used in the aquaculture industry for growing small zooplankton such as rotifers and for greenwater. They are also used in reef tanks for feeding corals and other filter feeders. It is 3600 times as dense as cultured algae, so 1 liter replaces almost 4 metric tons of live algae! Available in 1-quart & 1-pint bottles, and 1-liter bags. Nannochloropsis is the single best food for growing rotifers. It has a very high EPA level and can be frozen for long term storage. It also works well for greenwater.

Shellfish hatcheries: works very well with mussels. It has not been traditionally used with oysters and clams, however a study currently being done at a university in Los Angeles indicates that it can work as well or better than Isochrysis and Pavlova with larvae and post set. Storage: instant algae nannochloropsis can be stored in a refrigerator for 3 months (best if stored at -1° to 3°C) or it can be frozen for longer shelf life (2+ years). When frozen, the algae will “hard-freeze” like ice.

Pavlova

Pavlova is a small golden/brown flagellate that is very similar to Isochrysis. It has a very high DHA profile and is excellent for enriching rotifers and other zooplankton. It is very difficult to develop the Pavlova, that is the reason why it is not produced by many incubation facilities. Pavlova is similar in nutritional profile to Isochrysis, however it has a more sophisticated sterol composition so it is very popular with cold water fish hatcheries (such as cod) for enriching rotifers.

Pavlova has both a high DHA and EPA profile so its good for enriching zooplankton. We have received very good reports on larval survival from hatcheries that use it to enrich brine shrimp. Pavlova works very well for oysters, clams, mussels and scallops. It is also used to increase the DHA/EPA levels in broodstock.

Isochrysis

Isochrysis is a small golden/brown flagellate that is very commonly used in the aquaculture industry. It is high in DHA and often used to enrich zooplankton such as rotifers or Artemia. Used for DHA enrichment of rotifers.

It is also a good size for feeding brine shrimp and copepods. Isochrysis is the most commonly used algae for oysters, clams, mussels and scallops.

Tetraselmis

Tetraselmis is a large green flagellate with a very high lipid level. It also contains natural amino acids that stimulate feeding in marine animals. It is an excellent feed for larval shrimp. Used in conjunction with Nannochloropsis for producing rotifers.

It is also a good size for feeding brine shrimp. A standard feed for oysters, clams, mussels and scallops.

Rotifer Diet HD

Rotifer Diet™ HD is a marine microalgae feed product for producing high quality, high density, low cost rotifers. Rotifer Diet HD is a combination of the microalgae species Nannochloropsis & Tetraselmis and results in a 20% increase in rotifer volume over pure Nannochloropsis.

It is a 100% complete feeding solution, needing no other feed additives to produce dense cultures. Rotifer Diet HD was specifically designed for high density rotifer systems, but also works exceptionally well in low density and batch cultures.

Thalassiosira weissflogii

Thalassiosira weissflogii is a large diatom (6-20μm x 8-15μm) that is used in the shrimp and shellfish larviculture industry. This algae is considered by several hatcheries to be the single best algae for larval shrimp. The large cell size (16 times the biomass of Chaetoceros and 3 times the biomass of Tetraselmis) extends the algae feeding period until the end of the PL stage. During the winter, this algae is about 15 microns, but shrinks to about 5 microns during the summer.

The color of TW varies from brown to green to yellow, depending on the amount of chlorophyll in the culture. This color change does not in any way affect the quality of the algae. Good for feeding copepods and brine shrimp. Due to its large size, TW is a very good feed for post-set (200 microns and larger) oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, and for broodstock conditioning.

Shellfish Diet

Shellfish diet is a mix of five marine microalgae that all have demonstrated success with a variety of shellfish including oysters, clams, mussels and scallops. A mixed diet provides a much better nutritional profile for all types of shellfish, increasing both growth rates and survival. Shellfish diet can be used with preset larvae all the way up through broodstock and will typically perform as well as algae so it can be used as a complete live algae replacement. 1/4 of Shellfish diet will replace the equivalent to 1800 liters of dense algae culture. This product is available in plastic bottles of 1/4, 1-pint and 1-gallon. The quantity of cells changes depending on the time of the year, but is approximately 2 billions of cells per ml.

Spirulina powder, a type of blue-green algae, is often cultivated in both freshwater and seawater environments. Seawater can be a viable and even advantageous medium for growing spirulina, particularly for reducing the need for additional nutrients. However, spirulina grown in seawater may have a higher iodine content and require careful drying processes to maintain qualit.

Seawater can be a cost-effective and potentially more sustainable medium for spirulina cultivation, especially when supplemented with nutrients. Studies have shown that spirulina can thrive in seawater, and in some cases, even exhibit increased carbohydrate production and biomass concentration compared to freshwater cultures. 

The quality of spirulina, regardless of the cultivation medium, depends on factors like the source of the water, the cultivation methods, and the drying process. Spirulina harvested from clean sources and properly dried is essential for ensuring a high-quality product. 


A  large-scale  cultivation  experiment  demonstrated  that  Spirulina  platensis,  strain  SCS,  can  be  adapted  togrow  in  seawater  enriched  with  a  commercial  compound  fertilizer  (N: Ρ: Κ  =  12:12:12),  NaHCO3 andFeSO4.  To  avoid  excess  precipitation,  a  compound  fertilizer, which  contained  phosphate,  was  supplied  bydiffusion  through  a tubular  dialysis membrane  and  a small amount  of NaHCO3 was added. The average yieldof  biomass  in  84 days  of consecutive  production  was  10.3 g (dry  weight) m~2 day"1. The  protein and  aminoacids  contents  in  the  product  were  66.6%  and  62.2%  respectively.  We have shown  that  outdoor cultivationof  Spirulina  in seawater has potential for industrial production  without involving valuable farm land, employingless  expensive culture  medium which  can  be  recycled  and  giving higher  yield  and  higher quality products



Biochemical Changes
One of the most interesting side effects of culturing spirulina in seawater is that the carbohydrate content of it skyrockets while the protein content drops significantly.


Spirulina harvesting 
---
involves separating the algae from its liquid growth medium. This is typically done through filtration or centrifugation, followed by drying to produce a powder or flakes. The harvested spirulina can then be used as a food supplement or in other application
