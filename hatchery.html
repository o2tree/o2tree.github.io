	* How to keep rotifers alive? You can store live rotifers for one week in the refrigerator. Just give them a little algae every other day.
Some people do indeed freeze rotifers and feed them out to their corals.
Just make sure they don't get freezer burn!

[Lugol preservation technique](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pbr/17/4/17_P170407/_pdf/-char/en)


The life span of rotifers has been estimated to be between 3.4 to 4.4 days at 25°C.
Generally, the larvae become adult after 0.5 to 1.5 days and females thereafter start to lay eggs approximately every four hours.
It is believed that females can produce ten generations of offspring before they eventually die.

Facing starvation, some rotifers could even extend their life span; young Brachionus plicatilis suppressed reproduction
and about half of them survived for more than 16 days without any food, while the fed controls reproduced normally and
lived about 12 days (Yoshinaga, Hagiwara & Tsukamoto 2003a).

Can rotifers become dormant?
Like tardigrades, bdelloid rotifers have the ability to enter a dormant state called cryptobiosis,
or more specifically, anhydrobiosis. In this state, they can survive desiccation,
meaning the complete loss of water from their body, for long periods of time.

Kedalaman Air: Kedalaman perairan ideal untuk teripang bervariasi antara 1 hingga 3 meter, tergantung pada spesies yang dibudidayakan.
 Teripang pasir biasanya lebih cocok pada kedalaman 2 meter, sementara teripang gamat dapat hidup di perairan yang sedikit lebih dangkal.

Mysis Shrimp are nutritionally whole or balanced and provide your fish with plenty of protein, a little fat, and some vitamins and minerals.

## Microalgae Fertelzer Chaetoceros upscaling formulation (modified from Agudo 2006)

This is crucial information for anyone culturing diatoms for a sandfish hatchery.
Your provided dosages are a clear and effective recipe for promoting diatom growth. Let's break down what these numbers mean and how to use them correctly.

Interpretation of Your Dosages:

Your recipe uses two key components:

1. Sodium Metasilicate (Na₂SiO₃): 0.375 g per 10 L (or 7.5 g per 200 L)
   · Purpose: This is the most important nutrient for diatoms. Silicate (SiO₃) is the building block they use to construct their glass-like cell walls (called frustules). Without ample silicate, diatom growth will be poor, and other, less desirable algae may take over.
   · Calculation: This dosage equals a concentration of 37.5 mg per liter (ppm). This is a standard and effective concentration for benthic diatom culture.
2. Fertilizer (Manusol 30:10:10): 0.25 g per 10 L (or 5 g per 200 L)
   · Purpose: This provides the essential macronutrients:
     · Nitrogen (N): 30% - For protein and chlorophyll synthesis.
     · Phosphorus (P): 10% - For energy transfer (ATP) and nucleic acids.
     · Potassium (K): 10% - For enzyme activation and osmotic regulation.
   · Calculation: This dosage equals a concentration of 25 mg per liter (ppm). This is a good, balanced level to support growth without risking a harmful algal bloom of unwanted species.

# general techniques and methods in hatchery

All metals are suspect and should be avoided if possible. Titanium and stainless steel 316 may be
used in small amounts if absolutely necessary. If metal pump parts cannot be avoided, use stainless steel 316 or cast iron.
Metal should be coated with a tested epoxy paint wherever possible.

Step-by-Step Guide: How to Use This Recipe

This process assumes you are conditioning water that will be used to grow biofilm on PVC sheets or other substrates in a separate nursery tank.

Phase A: Preparing the Enriched Seawater

For a 200-L culture tank (a common size for conditioning):

1. Fill the tank with 200 liters of filtered (1-micron) and UV-sterilized seawater.
2. Add Silicate First: Weigh 7.5 grams of sodium metasilinate. Dissolve it completely in a small cup of fresh water from the tank. Once fully dissolved, pour this solution evenly throughout the tank.
3. Add Fertilizer Next: Weigh 5.0 grams of Manusol (30:10:10). Dissolve it completely in a separate small cup of tank water. Pour this solution evenly throughout the tank.
4. Aerate and Mix: Turn on the air stones to vigorously mix the nutrients into the water for at least 30 minutes.
5. Inoculate with Diatoms: Add your live, healthy diatom inoculum (Navicula, Amphora, etc.) to the tank. The water may slightly change color.
6. Condition: Let the tank run with aeration and light for 24-48 hours before using this water. This allows the diatoms to multiply and the chemistry to stabilize.

Phase B: Applying to the Nursery Tank with PVC Sheets

You have two main methods:

Method 1: Direct Application (Most Common)

1. Place your clean PVC sheets into the empty nursery tank that will hold the juvenile sandfish.
2. Fill the nursery tank directly with the pre-conditioned, nutrient-rich water from your 200-L culture tank.
3. The diatoms in the water will immediately begin to colonize the PVC sheets.
4. Provide light and gentle water flow. A golden-brown biofilm should be visible on the sheets within 3-5 days.

Method 2: Water Exchange Method

1. Fill your nursery tank (with PVC sheets already inside) with plain, filtered seawater.
2. Inoculate it with your diatom culture.
3. Add the nutrients directly to the nursery tank using the same per-liter ratio:
   · For every 10 liters of water in the nursery tank, add:
     · 0.375 g Sodium Metasilicate
     · 0.25 g Manusol (30:10:10)
4. This method is simpler but can be less consistent than pre-conditioning the water.

Critical Considerations and Best Practices

· Bio-Security: Always use sterilized water and clean equipment. The goal is to grow diatoms, not parasites or harmful bacteria.
· Light: Diatoms need light for photosynthesis. Provide 12-16 hours of light per day using full-spectrum or cool-white fluorescent/LED lights. Avoid direct sunlight, which can overheat the culture.
· Aeration: Gentle but constant aeration is needed to keep nutrients suspended and provide gas exchange, but it should not be so strong that it shears the delicate biofilm off the PVC sheets.
· Re-dosing: As the juveniles graze and the diatoms consume nutrients, you will need to replenish. After the initial setup, perform a 20% water change every few days and add 20% of the original nutrient dose (e.g., for a 200L tank, add 1.5g silicate and 1.0g fertilizer after the water change) to sustain growth.
· Observation: A healthy, diatom-dominated biofilm will be a smooth, golden-brown to dark brown color. If you see green, hair-like algae, it often means the silicate ratio is too low, or your initial inoculum was not strong enough in diatoms.

Comparison to Standard F/2 Medium

For reference, your recipe is similar to the classic F/2 algal medium used in aquaculture, but simplified. F/2 typically includes trace metals and vitamins. Your Manusol fertilizer provides the N-P-K, and the sodium metasilicate provides the Si. This simplification is perfectly adequate for many hatchery operations.

Conclusion: Your provided dosages are correct and represent a standard, effective recipe for cultivating the diatom biofilm essential for raising healthy sandfish juveniles. The key is consistent application and good husbandry practices.

## 1. Hatchery Design & Infrastructure  
### 📍 Location  
- Proximity to clean seawater (salinity **25–35 ppt**).
	- Minimizing the distance for seawater intake reduces pumping costs and potential issues with long pipe runs.
	- The seawater intake should be from depth seawater instead of shallow seawater (temperature, salinity, turbidity variation greatly day and night or  daily)
	- Locating the hatchery close to sea level avoids the need for powerful pumps to lift water, reducing operational costs.
	- The hatchery operations are expected to run year-round. However, there may be seasons when the seawater source may become turbid, caused by intense rainfall
	or storms. The sand-filter system described in earlier sections (Section 2.2.2.) can help reduce this turbidity. Additionally, water stored in the reservoir can be held longer (1–2 days)
	 to allow the remaining silt to settle, before the water is used in the tanks. Water exchange in broodstock tanks can also be delayed until the water source is clear of silt.
- Raw seawater needs to be filtered to remove debris and potentially sterilized to eliminate harmful bacteria and pathogen 
- Avoid polluted areas (industrial/agricultural runoff).  
- Reliable electricity (backup generator required).  
- Algal Culture:
	- Independent algal culture system: A dedicated space for producing phytoplankton (algae) is essential for feeding larvae and juveniles. 
	- Air supply and water treatment: Consider the air supply and water treatment needs for the algal cultures. 
	- Distribution of algae: Efficient methods for delivering algae to larval and juvenile tanks are necessary
- Biosecurity:
    - Segregation of different life stages:
    - Separate areas for broodstock, larvae, and juveniles minimize the risk of disease transmission.
    - Controlled access:
	- Limiting access to the hatchery and implementing strict hygiene protocols are essential.

## 2. Water Supply & Treatment  
### 🌊 Water Source  
- Seawater intake (sand filter + sedimentation tank).  
- Brackish water (if inland, use artificial sea salt).  

### 💧 Water Treatment System  
- Mechanical filtration (sand filter, drum filter).  
- Biological filtration (bio-balls, bio-media).[Microalgae and ditoms?](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8810035/table/t0001/)  
- [Disinfection (UV sterilizer, chlorine removal)](https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/oxidants-enhance-water-quality/).  
- Aeration (air blowers, diffusers).

#### [How Potassium Permanganate Works in Water Treatment](https://www.getwsu.com/potassium-permanganate/)
In water treatment applications, potassium permanganate acts as an oxidizer that reacts with:

Iron and manganese – oxidizes soluble iron (Fe2+) and manganese (Mn2+) into solid particles that can be filtered out
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) – removes unpleasant sulfur odors
Organic matter and algae – helps reduce biological growth and improve clarity
Taste and odor compounds – neutralizes earthy or musty smells often caused by decaying organic material

KMnO4 can reduce dissolved oxygen levels. 

Water Sterilization
---
Water sterilization requires two steps: prefiltration and disinfection. For prefiltration,
 use filters with a mesh of less than 200-300 microns at the water inlet to prevent entry of pathogens, predators and undesirable settleable solids.
 The filters should be maintained regularly by rinsing them with clean water and removing any deposits.
 When it comes to water disinfection, chemical disinfectants should be used to eliminate all germs. For 24 hours,
 add 20–30 ppm sodium hypochlorite 60 percent, 0.5–2.5 ppm KMnO4, and 10 ppm TCCA to the filtered water. During chemical disinfection,
 maintain maximum aeration. To get rid of the leftover chlorine, multiply the remaining chlorine concentration by three to get the right amount of sodium thiosulphate. Finally, repeat the process two to seven times throughout the course of 24 hours.


Critical Parameters:

When transporting *Penaeus vannamei* (Pacific white shrimp),
 the requirements for Post Larva 15 (PL15) and Post Larva 10 (PL10) differ mainly in terms of density, water quality, oxygen demand, and stress sensitivity due to their developmental stages.
 Below is a comparison:

### 1. Size & Development Stage
- PL10: Younger, smaller (≈ 10 days post-metamorphosis), more delicate, higher mortality risk.
- PL15: Older, larger (≈ 15 days post-metamorphosis), more robust, better stress tolerance.

### 2. Transport Density (Per Bag/Liter)
- PL10: Higher density possible (e.g., **5,000–10,000 PL10/L**) due to smaller size.
- PL15: Lower density (e.g., **3,000–5,000 PL15/L**) due to larger size & higher oxygen demand.

### 3. Oxygen Requirements
- PL10: Lower absolute oxygen demand but more sensitive to hypoxia.
- PL15: Higher oxygen consumption per individual but more resilient to fluctuations.

### 4. Water Quality Sensitivity
- PL10: More sensitive to ammonia, temperature swings, and salinity changes.
- PL15: Hardier, tolerates slight variations better.

### 5. Temperature & Salinity
- Both require 26–30°C and salinity 25–35 ppt, but:
  - PL10: Needs stricter stability.
  - PL15: Can handle minor deviations.

### 6. Stress Management
- PL10: More prone to stress; may need additives (e.g., **buffers, probiotics**).
- PL15: Handles transport stress better; fewer additives needed.

### 7. Transport Duration
- PL10: Best for shorter hauls (<6–8 hrs).
- PL15: Can endure longer transport (up to 12–24 hrs) with proper aeration.

### Key Takeaways
- PL10: Higher density possible but needs more careful monitoring of water quality.
- PL15: Lower density but hardier for long-distance transport.
- For both: Use oxygen-filled bags, temperature control, and minimal stress handling.

Would you like specific protocols for packing or acclimation?


Here’s a step-by-step protocol for packing and transporting PL10 vs. PL15 *Litopenaeus vannamei*, including acclimation procedures to ensure high survival rates.  

---

### 1. Pre-Transport Preparation  
#### A. Water Quality Adjustment  
- Salinity: Match transport water to the source farm’s salinity (± 2 ppt).  
- Temperature: Gradually adjust to 26–28°C (avoid sudden changes).  
- pH: Maintain 7.8–8.2 (use buffering agents if needed).  
- Ammonia/Nitrite: Must be <0.1 ppm (use zeolite or probiotics if high).  

#### B. Starvation  
- PL10: Stop feeding 6–8 hrs before packing (gut clearance).  
- PL15: Stop feeding 8–12 hrs before packing (larger body size = longer clearance time).  

---

### 2. Packing Protocol  
#### A. Bag Specifications  
- Use oxygen-filled polyethylene bags (thickness ≥ 0.8 mm).  
- Fill 1/3 with water, 2/3 pure oxygen (O₂).  
- Add 2–5 g/L of activated charcoal (for ammonia control).  

#### B. Stocking Density  
| Stage  | Bag Size (L) | Density (PL/L) | Max Transport Time |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| PL10 | 10–15      | 5,000–10,000  | 6–8 hrs       |
| PL15 | 10–15      | 3,000–5,000   | 12–24 hrs     |  

Note:  
- Reduce density by 20–30% if transport exceeds 12 hrs.  
- For air transport, decrease density further (PL10: 4,000–6,000/L, PL15: **2,000–3,000/L**).  

#### C. Additives (Optional but Recommended)  
- Stress Coat: 1–2 ppm (e.g., **aloe vera extract**).  
- Probiotics: *Bacillus spp.* (1–2 ppm) to reduce ammonia.  
- Antifungal/Mild Sedative: For long hauls (e.g., 2–5 ppm clove oil for PL15 only).  

---

### 3. Transport Conditions  
- Temperature: Maintain 26–28°C (use cooling boxes or **insulated containers**).  
- Oxygen Monitoring: Ensure O₂ > 5 ppm (use oxygen tablets if needed).  
- Avoid Light & Vibration: Keep bags in dark, stable conditions.  

---

### 4. Post-Transport Acclimation  
#### A. Floating for Temperature Adjustment  
- Float unopened bags in destination pond for 15–30 mins to equalize temperature.  

#### B. Gradual Salinity Mixing (If Needed)  
- Step 1: Open bag, add small amounts of pond water every 5 mins for 30–45 mins.  
- Step 2: Release PLs gently near aerated areas.  

#### C. Post-Release Care  
- PL10: Feed immediately with high-protein diet (e.g., *Artemia*).  
- PL15: Can wait 2–3 hrs before feeding (more resilient).  

---

### 5. Survival Rate Expectations  
| Condition            | PL10 Survival (%) | PL15 Survival (%) |  
|----------------------|------------------|------------------|  
| Ideal Transport  | 85–90%           | 90–95%           |  
| Long Haul (>12h) | 70–80%           | 85–90%           |  

---

### Key Differences Summary  
| Factor          | PL10 Requirements | PL15 Requirements |  
|----------------|------------------|------------------|  
| Density    | Higher (5–10k/L) | Lower (3–5k/L)   |  
| O₂ Demand  | Moderate         | Higher           |  
| Stress     | More sensitive   | More tolerant    |  
| Max Time   | 6–8 hrs         | 12–24 hrs        |

LiveSeafood, [6/27/25 10:50 PM]
Here’s a modified transport protocol for specific conditions, including air freight, hot climates, and long-distance road transport, with adjustments for PL10 vs. PL15 *Vannamei* shrimp:  

---

### 1. Air Freight Protocol (PL10 & PL15)  
#### Key Challenges:  
- Pressure changes → Risk of bag rupture.  
- Strict airline regulations → Limited oxygen volume.  
- No access to temperature control in cargo hold.  

#### Adjustments:  
| Factor | PL10 | PL15 |  
|--------|------|------|  
| Bag Thickness | 0.1–0.15 mm double-layered | 0.15–0.2 mm double-layered |  
| Oxygen Ratio | 50% water, 50% O₂ (to prevent bursting) | 40% water, 60% O₂ (more resilient) |  
| Density | 3,000–4,000/L (reduce by 30%) | 1,500–2,500/L (reduce by 40%) |  
| Additives | 5 ppm EDTA (anti-stress) + 2 ppm probiotics | 3 ppm vitamin C (immune boost) |  
| Packaging | Styrofoam box + coolant gel packs (if >6 hrs) | Insulated box + thermal lining |  

Note:  
- Use oxygen-absorbing pads (for airline safety compliance).  
- Avoid ice (risk of cold shock; use chilled gel packs instead).  

---

### 2. Hot Climate Transport (Road, >30°C Ambient)  
#### Key Challenges:  
- Heat stress → Increased metabolism → Oxygen depletion.  
- Ammonia spikes due to higher metabolic waste.  

#### Adjustments:  
| Factor | PL10 | PL15 |  
|--------|------|------|  
| Cooling Method | Frozen water bottles (wrapped in cloth) | Phase-change cooling packs |  
| Density | Reduce by 40% (e.g., 3,000–4,000/L → 1,800–2,400/L**) | **Reduce by 30% (e.g., **2,000–3,000/L → 1,400–2,100/L**) |  
| Oxygen | Pure O₂ + oxygen tablets (as backup) | O₂ with slow-release tablets |  
| Additives | 5 ppm sodium bicarbonate (pH buffer) | 2 ppm potassium chloride (ion regulator) |  
| Travel Time | Only during cooler hours (night/early morning) | Max 8 hrs (daytime) |  

Emergency Measures:  
- If bags overheat, gradually lower temperature (avoid sudden cooling).  
- Ammonia detox: Add zeolite chips (1–2 g/L) in extreme cases.  

---

### 3. Long-Distance Road Transport (>24 Hours)  
#### Key Challenges:  
- Oxygen depletion → Risk of mass mortality.  
- Accumulated waste → Ammonia toxicity.  

#### Adjustments:  
| Factor | PL10 | PL15 |  
|--------|------|------|  
| Density | Max 1,500/L | Max 1,000/L |  
| Water Exchange | Not recommended (too stressful) | Partial exchange (10%) after 12 hrs if necessary |  
| O₂ Supply | Oxygen generator or cylinder with regulator | O₂ cylinders + diffuser stones |  
| Sedation | Avoid (too sensitive) | 1–2 ppm clove oil (if >24 hrs) |  
| Monitoring | Check O₂/ammonia every 4 hrs | Check every 6 hrs |  

Survival Tips:  
- Use battery-powered air pumps for backup aeration.  
- Darken transport containers to reduce stress.  

---

### 4. Emergency Recovery Protocol  
If PLs arrive weak or stressed:  
1. Gradual Acclimation:  
   - Float bags for 45–60 mins (not 30 mins).  
   - Drip-acclimate with pond water over 1–2 hrs.  
2. Revival Additives:  
   - PL10: 5 ppm glucose + 1 ppm vitamin B12.  
   - PL15: 3 ppm calcium magnesium + probiotics.  
3. Post-Release Care:  
   - PL10: Hold in nursery tanks (1–2 days) before pond release.  
   - PL15: Can be released directly but avoid feeding for 4–6 hrs.  

---

### Final Recommendations by Condition  
| Transport Type | Best for PL10? | Best for PL15? |  
|---------------|---------------|---------------|  
| Air Freight | Only if <6 hrs | Preferred (more resilient) |  
| Hot Climate | Avoid if possible | Use with cooling packs |  
| Long Road Haul | Not recommended | Yes (with O₂ support) |  

For highest survival:  
- PL10: Keep transport <8 hrs, avoid extreme temps.

1. Temperature Shock (Most common)  
   - Expose to 5°C above ambient for 30–60 mins.  
2. Drying + Sunlight Exposure  
   - Keep broodstock dry for 30 mins, then return to water.  
3. Gonad Stimulation (Experimental)  
   - Serotonin injection (1–2 µg/g body weight).  

### 🥚 Egg Collection & Fertilization  
- Eggs: 100,000–500,000 per female.  
- Sperm: Dilute in seawater before mixing with eggs.  
- Fertilization rate: 70–90% under optimal conditions.

## 4. Larval Rearing (Auricularia → Pentactula)  
| Stage | Duration | Feed | Key Requirements |  
|-------|---------|------|-----------------|  
| Auricularia | 8–12 days | Microalgae (*Chaetoceros*, *Isochrysis*) | Gentle aeration, 28°C |  
| Doliolaria | 3–5 days | Mixed algae + yeast | Reduced light |  
| Pentactula | 5–7 days | Benthic diatoms (*Navicula*) | Settlement substrates |  

Water Quality:  
- pH: 7.8–8.3  
- Ammonia: <0.1 ppm  
- DO: >5 mg/L  

---

## 5. Juvenile Settlement & Nursery  
### 🪨 Settlement Substrates  
- PVC plates (coated with biofilm).  
- Coral rubble/seaweed mats (natural texture).  

### 📈 Nursery Grow-Out  
- Tank size: 2–5 tons (stocking density: **1,000–2,000 juveniles/m²**).  
- Feed:  
  - Diatom paste (daily).  
  - Seaweed powder (30% protein).  
- Survival rate: 30–60% (if managed well).  

---

## 6. Key Equipment Checklist  
| Equipment | Purpose |  
|-----------|---------|  
| Air blowers & diffusers | Aeration for larvae |  
| Water heaters/chillers | Temp control |  
| UV sterilizer | Pathogen control |  
| Microscopes (40–100x) | Larval monitoring |  
| Algal photobioreactors | Live feed production |  
| Settlement plates | Juvenile attachment |  

---

## 7. Disease & Biosecurity Management  
### 🦠 Common Diseases  
- Skin ulceration (bacterial *Vibrio* spp.) → Treat with oxytetracycline baths.  
- Parasitic protozoa → Formalin dips (50 ppm for 30 mins).  

### 🔒 Biosecurity Measures  
- Quarantine new broodstock (7–10 days).  
- Disinfect tanks (iodine, hydrogen peroxide).  
- PCR testing for pathogens.

*Diatoms are single cell eukaryotic microalgae*


Alka-siltzer and **LUGOL solutions**:
Phytoplankton are fixed with a Lugol-glycerol solution (2-3 % glycerol). Glycerol is required for flagellates.
 Please look at European Committee for Standardization, 2015. According to the standard method (European Committee for Standardization 2006),
 phytoplankton enumerations were carried out under an inverted microscope (Olympus CKX41) at magnifications of 400 and 600X. For each sample,
 at least 350 settling units of the dominant species were counted. Phytoplankton biovolume was calculated by multiplying the cell density
 and mean biovolume of the taxon, which was taken approximating geometric shapes of the least 25 individuals (Sun and Liu 2003).

### How to Collect Rotifer Eggs: A Complete Guide

[Selective breeding rotifers](https://library.enaca.org/Grouper/HalongWorkshop/Inneke.pdf)

RESTING ROTIFER CULTURES
Rotifers, like Artemia, produce resting eggs or cysts. Yet, rotifers are uniquely different
 since they reproduce asexually (without sex) and only one rotifer becomes millions in a matter of days. Florida Aqua Farms pioneered this process and offer vials of lab cultured rotifer cysts. Cysts stored in a freezer can last over two years. Remove cysts from the vial, place in 1/2″ of water, cover, place in continuous low light. Hatching and feeding commences within 24 to 36 hours and reproduction about 18 hours after hatch. Resting eggs of the saltwater rotifer Brachionus manjavacas (specified by S) and the freshwater rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (specified by F) are now available. We offer only the “L” strain which are 130-340 µm long compared to new hatched Artemia which are 450-500 µm long. Smaller strains can be cultured by consistently sieving normal cultures for smaller individuals and culturing them. To determine what size inoculant would best suit your needs we offer a theoretical calculation of inoculant size and the approximate days for a population to reach 1 billion. Results vary depending on water quality, food and temperature.
  
*(For Aquaculture, Aquariums, or Live Feed Production)*  

Rotifers (especially *Brachionus plicatilis*) are crucial live feed for fish/shrimp larvae. Their resting eggs (called *cysts*) allow long-term storage and easy culture revival. Here’s how to collect them efficiently.  

---
[dormant rotifer](https://www.redono.fi/rotifers/)

## 1. When & Where to Find Rotifer Eggs  
### 🔎 Natural Habitats  
✔ Brackish ponds (salinity 10–25 ppt)  
✔ Coastal lagoons (look in sediment)  
✔ Aquaculture tanks (check tank bottoms & filters)  

### ⏳ Best Conditions for Egg Production  
- Stress triggers (food shortage, crowding, temperature swings)  
- Seasonal – Often appear as water cools in autumn  
- In culture – Eggs accumulate after population crashes  

---

## 2. Collection Methods  

### Method 1: From Wild Environments  
Materials Needed:  
- Plankton net (50–100µm mesh)  
- Sieve (20–30µm mesh to separate eggs from debris)  
- Turkey baster or pipette  
- Microscope (for verification)  

Steps:  
1. Scrape sediment from pond/lagoon edges.  
2. Filter through 100µm net (removes large debris).  
3. Wash through 30µm sieve (retains eggs, which are ~50–100µm).  
4. Examine under microscope – Look for brownish oval eggs (see image below).  

### Method 2: From Cultured Rotifers  
Materials Needed:  
- Airline tubing (for siphoning)  
- Bright flashlight (eggs sink, shine light to spot them)  
- Fine mesh (30µm)  

Steps:  
1. Stop aeration – Let rotifers settle for 10 mins.  
2. Siphon bottom debris where eggs accumulate.  
3. Filter through 30µm mesh – Retain eggs, discard water.  
4. Rinse with freshwater (briefly) to kill pathogens.  

---

## 3. Identifying Rotifer Eggs  
- Size: 50–100µm (varies by species)  
- Shape: Oval, sometimes with ridges  
- Color: Brown/amber when mature  
- Under microscope: Thick-walled, often slightly asymmetrical  

![Rotifer eggs vs debris](https://example.com/rotifer-eggs-microscope.jpg)  
*(Left: Rotifer eggs | Right: Algae/dirt for comparison)*  

---

## 4. Storing & Hatching Eggs  
### Storage (for months/years)  
✔ Dry storage – Keep in cool, dark place (4°C) with silica gel  
✔ Wet storage – In saltwater at 4°C (slows metabolism)  

### Hatching (when needed)  
1. Rehydrate in 15–20 ppt saltwater.  
2. Aerate gently (too much turbulence prevents hatching).  
3. Add food (Nannochloropsis or yeast) after 24h.  
4. First hatchlings appear in 1–3 days.  

---

## 5. Troubleshooting  
| Problem | Solution |  
|------------|-------------|  
| No eggs in culture | Induce stress (starvation, temp shock) |  
| Eggs not hatching | Try lower salinity (10 ppt) or warmer water (25°C) |  
| Fungus on eggs | Dip in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 sec |  
| Too much debris | Use sugar flotation method (mix sample with 50% sugar, spin, eggs float) |  

---

## 6. Advanced: Increasing Egg Production  
- "Boom-and-bust" cycling – Let culture crash naturally  
- Temperature manipulation – Shift between 15°C and 25°C  
- Food limitation – Starve for 2 days, then feed heavily  

---

### Final Tips  
✅ Commercial sources sell rotifer eggs (~$10/g) if collecting is difficult.  
✅ Label samples with date/location for strain tracking.  
✅ Use eggs within 2 years – Viability declines over time.

# Vannamei highlist
Highlights
* Clear differences in feeding behaviour between male and female Litopenaeus vannamei.
* Males arrived to the feeding tray(size tray: 60cm x 60cm or 100cm x 100cm) faster and fed for longer than females.
* Females exhibited greater levels of inactivity and more signs of stress than males.
* These behavioural differences are important when choosing mono- vs mixed-sex culture.

## Rotifer
Copepods and rotifers are both types of small aquatic organisms, particularly important in marine and freshwater ecosystems
 as they are a food source for many fish and other invertebrates. However, they belong to 
different groups: copepods are crustaceans (Arthropoda), while rotifers are rotifers (Rotifera).
Copepods are more common in reef tanks, where they contribute to the tank's overall biodiversity
and can be cultured. Rotifers, on the other hand, often require specific conditions
and are typically cultured separately, but they can be a valuable food source, especially for corals. 

Copepods:
Classification: Crustaceans (Arthropoda). 
Habitat: Often associated with live rocks in reef tanks. 
Diet: Primarily feed on phytoplankton, contributing to nutrient cycling in the tank. 
Reef Tank Role: Provide biodiversity, contribute to nutrient cycling, and serve as a food source for certain fish and invertebrates. 
Cultures: Can be cultured in refugiums or other dedicated systems. 

Rotifers:
Classification: Rotifers (Rotifera). 
Habitat: Found in freshwater environments, including lakes, ponds, and even temporary puddles. 
Diet: Primarily feed on algae and other small organisms. 
Reef Tank Role: Serve as a food source, especially for corals and larval fish. 
Cultures: Typically cultured in separate tanks, often using algae or specialized feed.

## [High pressure (30.40 inHg and higher) and Low Pressure (29.60 inHg or lower)  on Ocean about fish](https://wildhunter.ie/blogs/fishing-blog/effects-of-air-pressure-on-fish)

Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere in a specific area, usually measured in millibars (mb) and inches of Mercury (inHg).
 A number of factors can influence the barometric pressure in a given area, including altitude, wind patterns, and temperature.

* **A normal barometric pressure reading is typically between 29.70 inHg and 30.40 inHg**

*  when there’s low barometric pressure and less pressure on a fish’s body, the bladder expands.
   Fish may swim deeper where the water pressure is higher as a way to adjust, becoming less interested in feeding until conditions normalize.

* As we mentioned above, most agree that fishing is slow on both high-pressure and low-pressure days.** If the barometric pressure is above 30.50 inHg or below 29.60 inHg**, you might be better off waiting until the pressure normalizes.

* High Pressure (Good Weather): During periods of high atmospheric pressure, the air pressing down on the water is greater,
  slightly compressing the water. Fish with swim bladders experience a slight reduction in the organ’s volume,
  making them naturally sink a bit. To counteract this, they expend energy adjusting their position in the water column,
  which can make them less active or cautious, influencing their feeding and movement.

* Low Pressure (Bad Weather): When low-pressure systems approach, such as before a storm, the pressure exerted on the water decreases.
  This reduction causes the swim bladder to expand, making fish feel more buoyant. Fish typically respond by moving to deeper waters
  to alleviate the over-buoyancy and find stability, often decreasing their feeding activity in these moments.
  This is why anglers sometimes find it harder to catch fish before a storm.

The Pacific oyster can tolerate a wide temperature range from -2° to 35°C, but for optimal reproduction temperatures over 20°C are required. This may explain why there appear to be no self-sustaining populations of Pacific oysters on the West Coast and why oyster farming in this region requires continuous seeding in order to be sustainable.


Because oysters are filter feeders, contaminants may concentrate in the oyster’s flesh. During a post-harvest process called conditioning, oysters are kept in tanks of purified seawater for at least three days to eliminate possible contaminants by maximising their natural filtering activity.

After conditioning, oysters are inspected and packed into polystyrene boxes and kept cool with gel packs or ice bottles before being transported. The cool chain is maintained at between 4 and 8℃.

## Sebass vs Snapper
- diffferent
- which one taste better




|The table below provides a quick comparison of the availability and cost of snapper and grouper:|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


|Fish|	Availability|	Cost|
|----|--------------|--------|
|Snapper|	Common in Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean|	Higher price due to demand and difficulty of catching|
|Grouper|	Common in Atlantic and Pacific oceans|	More affordable due to abundance and ease of catching|



## Snapper vs Grouper
Both of these species are known for having firm yet moist meat while having the added health benefit of being low in fat. Snapper is slightly sweeter and the meat more delicate, especially when grilled, than Grouper. Most compare its flavor and texture to be similar to that of halibut or sea bass. Grouper on the other hand is milder or more subtle in flavor making it perfect for absorbing either dressings or marinades

## A shallow intake is far more exposed to the dynamic conditions of the immediate coastal environment. The main consequences are:

1. Extreme Temperature Fluctuations:

· Problem: Shallow water heats up rapidly under the sun and cools down quickly at night or in cold weather. The hatchery lacks a large, thermally-buffered water source.
· Impact: Larval stages of most marine species (e.g., shrimp, fish, oysters) are incredibly sensitive to temperature shifts. Sudden changes can cause:
  · Thermal Shock: Direct mortality.
  · Increased Stress: Leading to lower immunity and higher susceptibility to disease.
  · Unpredictable Development Rates: Throwing off feeding schedules and metamorphosis, leading to uneven batches.

2. High Turbidity and Siltation:

· Problem: Wave action in shallow areas easily resuspends sediments, clay, and organic particles. Even a light storm can turn the water muddy for days.
· Impact:
  · Clogged Filters: Rapidly fouls sand filters, cartridge filters, and sieve screens, requiring constant backwashing and maintenance.
  · Gill Damage: Fine particles can damage the delicate gills of larvae and broodstock, impairing respiration and overall health.
  · Reduced Light Penetration: Can affect algal cultures (if used for live feed) within the hatchery's system.

3. Poor and Fluctuating Water Quality:

· Problem: Shallow, near-shore water is heavily influenced by land-based activities.
· Impacts:
  · Pollutants: Risk of contamination from agricultural runoff (pesticides, fertilizers), sewage, oil, or industrial waste.
  · Eutrophication: High nutrient levels from runoff can lead to algal blooms. When these algae die, they decompose and consume oxygen, leading to hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions.
  · Salinity Instability: After heavy rainfall, shallow areas can experience a drastic drop in salinity (hyposalinity), which is lethal to marine organisms.

4. Low Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Levels:

· Problem: Oxygen solubility in water decreases as temperature rises. Warm, shallow water holds less oxygen. Furthermore, biological activity (decomposition of organic matter) consumes oxygen.
· Impact: Chronically low DO levels stress animals, suppress appetite, slow growth, and can directly cause mortality.

5. High Load of Pathogens and Predators:

· Problem: Shallow coastal waters are often rich in biological life, including the larvae of predators (e.g., jellyfish, crab larvae) and parasites, as well as bacteria and viruses (e.g., Vibrio spp.).
· Impact: The intake pipe can act as a direct conduit for these threats into the culture tanks. This constant bombardment makes disease outbreaks much more likely and diUfficult to control.

6. Vulnerability to Physical Disturbances:

· Problem: The intake structure and pipeline itself are exposed.
· Impact:
  · Wave Action: Can damage the intake head or pipeline.
  · Siltation: The intake can become buried in sand or silt during storms, cutting off the water supply entirely.
  · Boating & Fishing: Higher risk of damage from anchors or fishing gear in shallow waters.

---

How Hatcheries Mitigate These Problems

A well-designed hatchery will never rely on raw, untreated water from a shallow intake. It must invest heavily in infrastructure to process the incoming water. This adds significant operational cost and complexity.

1. Intake Design:

· Extending the Intake: The best solution is to extend the intake pipeline hundreds of meters out to sea, beyond the surf zone and into deeper, more stable water.
· Subsurface Intakes: Using wells (beach wells, seabed filters) that draw water that has been naturally filtered through the sand and substrate. This provides excellent pre-filtration and thermal stability.

2. Sophisticated Water Treatment:

· Sedimentation Tanks / Settling Ponds: The first step is to let heavy particles settle out.
· Multi-Stage Filtration: Using rapid sand filters, cartridge filters, and UV sterilizers to remove particles and pathogens. This requires constant maintenance.


## hardshell vs softshell result in high and low salinity shirmp culture
Hard shell lobsters also have less water weight, while soft
shell lobsters contain more water. This difference in yield is
reflected in the lower pricing of soft shell lobsters. For comparison, the average
yield for hard shells is roughly 20% to 28% meat, while soft shells contain around 15% to
20% meat.

* A freshwater dip is a treatment for saltwater fish, like groupers, to help remove parasites.
 It involves temporarily placing the fish in fresh water for a short period, typically 3-5 minutes, to kill or loosen parasites.
 This is a pre-quarantine treatment and should not be relied upon as the sole treatment for a disease.

Weak fish:
Avoid freshwater dips on fish that are already weak or dying, as they can be fatal. 

Potential side effects:
Some fish may have difficulty returning to their normal salinity after a freshwater dip, and may need assistance to regain their balance. 

Aeration:
Ensure the freshwater dip container has adequate aeration to provide oxygen to the fish

Efektivitas Pemberian Minyak Cengkeh sebagai Obat Bius pada Ikan Kerapu Cantang

Penelitian penggunaan minyak cengkeh dengan konsentrasi 5, 10 dan 15 ppm sebagai bahan anastesi pada transportasi tertutup ikan Kerapu cantang memberikan hasil tingkat kelangsungan hidup sebesar 76,67%, 86,67%, dan 80%, sedangkan tanpa penambahan minyak cengkeh tingkat kelangsungan hidup ikan kerapu adalah 60% pada pada transportasi dengan pemberian MS 222 70 ppm tingkat kelangsungan hidup mencapai 90%.
Minyak cengkeh merupakan salah satu obat bius alami yang telah dikembangkan dan digunakan sebagai pengganti obat bius kimia seperti MS 222.
Minyak cengkeh diperoleh dari ekstrak daun, batang dan bunga tanaman cengkeh. Minyak cengkeh diketahui mengandung senyawa eugenol yang bersifat
analgesik atau mengurangi rasa sakit, selain itu juga mengandung senyawa kartiofilin yang bersifat sebagai antiseptik. Minyak cengkeh digunakan sebagai anestesi lokal pada hewan dan manusia dan memiliki efek sedasi pada hewan air. Namun senyawa tersebut juga memiliki aktivitas insektisida sehingga jika digunakan secara berlebihan dapat menyebabkan kematian pada ikan.

Pemberian anestesi minyak cengkeh juga mempengaruhi total leukosit pada ikan kerapu setelah transportasi selama 10 jam.
 Pada penelitian ini jumlah leukosit mengalami perbedaan bermakna antara perlakuan negatif dan kontrol.
 Leukosit merupakan salah satu bagian darah yang berfungsi sebagai antibodi non spesifik. Saat ikan mengalami kondisi stres, 
jumlah leukosit dapat meningkat sebagai bentuk tindakan pertahanan akibat stresor.

Para nelayan di Riau, seperti Indragiri Hilir,  belakangan ini ‘berburu’ mendapatkan ikan tirusan atau tirus karena harga yang selangit. Ikan dengan nama latin  Otolithoides pama, termasuk famili sciaenidae,  harga per ekor bisa mencapai puluhan juta rupiah.
Yang bernilai tinggi dari ikan tirusan adalah gelembung (limpanya). Pembeli atau pengepul biasa mengupah orang yang ahli lagi untuk membelah perut ikan ini.

Hasil pencatatan BPPMHKP Pekanbaru, pengiriman gelembung ikan sepanjang 2019-2023 mencapai 1.204 kali atau 36.895 kilogram. Sumbernya dari enam daerah penghasil ikan di
1. Tembilahan,
2. Bengkalis, 
3. Dumai,
4. Selat Panjang, 
5. Pekanbaru dan 
6. Panipahan.

Setidaknya ada enam pengirim utama mendominasi dalam perdagangan gelembung ikan di Riau.

Data ini tidak spesifik menyebut jenis ikan penghasil gelembung renang itu. Selain tirusan, gelembung yang biasa diperdagangkan juga produk turunan dari ikan malong (Muraenesox cinereus).

# [Ikan Malong (Muraenesox cinereus)](https://indiabiodiversity.org/species/show/232787)
Malong ( Muraenesox cinereus )adalah spesies ikan Sidat dalam keluarga pike conger, Muraenesocidae .
 Mereka terutama hidup di dasar lunak di perairan laut dan air payau hingga kedalaman 800 m (2.600 ft), tapi bisa masuk ke air tawar.

Sea cucumbers, prized for their commercial value, benefit from diets containing microalgae such as Chaetoceros and Isochrysis, 
which enhance growth and survival rates. Similarly, for sea urchins and seahorses, microalgae like Isochrysis and Chaetoceros are
