- sludge
The sludge had been dewatered using a drum filter and dried using an oil-heated drum dryer (Scanship AS, Tønsberg, Norge) to a final dry matter
content of 85-90% and was stored at ambient temperature until receipt. Sludge particle size was standardized to <1 mm by sifting
through a 1-mm stainless steel sieve (wired mesh) and was subsequently stored at -20°C until feed preparation

- measure of protein

Protein was determined as nitrogen (N) in ground freeze-dried samples using a CHNS–O elemental combustion system (Costech Instruments ECS 4010) at a temperature of
approximately 1000°C, where the sample N is converted to N gas/oxides. Results were expressed in g N per 100 g of dried
sample and a N-to-protein conversion factor of 6.25 was used.

Fatty acids (lipid) were analysed according to ISO 12966-2 and ISO 5509, and carbohydrate content was calculated as the difference between total weight subtracted water, protein, lipid,
and ash. For each feed formulation, macronutrient content in
Table 2 was calculated from the known composition of each separate feed ingredient (Table 1

# Binder

LiveSeafood, [9/23/25 9:25 AM]
Of course. This is a classic comparison in feed and food science. Choosing between gelatin and agar as a binder depends heavily on the specific requirements of your feed, particularly regarding water stability and texture.

Here is a detailed comparison of gelatin and agar as binders for aquafeeds.

📊 Gelatin vs. Agar: A Direct Comparison

Feature Gelatin (Animal-based) Agar (Seaweed-based)
Source Derived from collagen (from bones, skins of pigs/cattle/fish). Extracted from red seaweed (e.g., Gelidium, Gracilaria).
Chemical Nature Protein. Complex polysaccharide (a type of fiber).
Gelling Mechanism Thermo-reversible: Melts when warmed (around 35-40°C) and sets when cooled. Thermo-irreversible: Once it sets after boiling and cooling, it does not re-melt when heated (it remains stable until it chars at very high temperatures).
Gel Texture Elastic, flexible, and chewy. Firm, brittle, and crisp.
Water Stability Good. Forms a strong matrix that reduces leaching. However, it can soften in warm water. Excellent. Creates an incredibly stable gel that is highly resistant to dissolving in warm water, making it one of the best binders for water stability.
Activation Required Yes. Must be dissolved in warm water (typically 50-60°C) to activate. Yes. Must be boiled for a few minutes to fully hydrate and activate.
Nutritional Contribution Digestible protein. Indigestible soluble fiber (acts as a prebiotic).
Cost Moderately expensive. Generally more expensive than gelatin.
Suitability for Vegetarian/Vegan Diets No (animal-derived). Yes (plant-derived).

---

🧪 Key Functional Differences & How to Choose

The choice boils down to the "thermo-reversible" vs. "thermo-irreversible" property. This single difference dictates which binder is best for your application.

When to Choose AGAR (The Seaweed Binder)

Agar is the superior choice when maximum water stability is the absolute top priority.

· Why: Because its gel does not melt, a pellet bound with agar will maintain its integrity for a very long time, even in warm water. It will slowly erode as the animal eats it, rather than disintegrating into a mush.
· Ideal for:
  · Feeds for slow-feeding aquatic species like shrimp, sea cucumbers (sandfish), and bottom-dwellers.
  · Larval feeds where a tiny, highly stable particle is needed.
  · Situations where you need a very firm, non-elastic texture.
  · Formulating vegetarian or vegan aquafeeds.

When to Choose GELATIN (The Animal Protein Binder)

Gelatin is the better choice when you need a softer, more flexible, and highly palatable pellet.

· Why: The elastic gel is easier for many fish to bite and chew. Its protein content can also contribute to the nutritional profile.
· Ideal for:
  · Soft-moist feeds for broodstock or larvae.
  · Feeds for fish that prefer a softer texture.
  · Applications where the binding needs to be strong but not rock-hard.
  · When you want to add a digestible protein source to the feed.

💡 Practical Recommendation for Sandfish Feed

Given your interest in sandfish (Holothuria scabra), which are slow-feeding detritivores that need a feed to remain stable on the seafloor for extended periods, agar is likely the technically superior choice.

· Reason: The thermo-irreversible gel of agar will ensure the feed pellet does not quickly dissolve and foul the water, allowing the sandfish ample time to find and consume it.

However, the final decision should consider:

1. Cost: Agar is expensive. You must determine if the improved stability justifies the higher feed cost.
2. Palatability: You must ensure the sandfish will actually eat the agar-bound feed. A small-scale test is essential.
3. Combination Approach: Some feed formulators use a combination of binders (e.g., a base of cheaper starch like tapioca with a small percentage of agar) to balance cost and performance.

Next Step: I would recommend running a simple water stability test. Create small feed pellets using gelatin and others using agar at the same concentration. Place them in containers of seawater and observe how long they take to fall apart.

This will give you a clear, practical answer for your specific recipe.

I hope this detailed comparison helps you make an informed decision for your project.


📊 Binder Showdown: Gelatin vs. Agar vs. Sago

Feature Gelatin (Animal-based) Agar (Seaweed-based) Sago (Plant-based)
Source Collagen from animal parts (skin, bones). Red seaweed (e.g., Gelidium). Pith of the sago palm (Metroxylon sagu).
Chemical Nature Protein. Complex polysaccharide (soluble fiber). Starch (a carbohydrate, very similar to tapioca).
Primary Binding Mechanism Forms a thermo-reversible, elastic gel. Forms a thermo-irreversible, firm and brittle gel. Starch gelatinization: granules swell with heat/water to form a viscous paste.
Water Stability Good. Strong but can soften in warm water. Excellent. The gold standard for water stability; very slow to disintegrate. Fair to Moderate. Better than no binder, but susceptible to softening and leaching.
Pellet Texture Elastic, flexible, and chewy. Very firm, hard, and brittle. Soft, crumbly, and dough-like.
Nutritional Contribution Digestible protein. Indigestible fiber (acts as a prebiotic). Digestible carbohydrates (energy).
Relative Cost Moderate to High. High (most expensive of the three). Very Low (often the cheapest option).
Best Suited For Soft-moist feeds, palatability enhancement. Critical water stability (shrimp, sandfish). Low-cost feeds for fast-feeding fish.

🧠 How to Choose: A Practical Guide

Your choice depends on balancing three key factors: Water Stability, Cost, and Feed Purpose.

1. Choose AGAR for Maximum Performance

· When: Your absolute top priority is keeping the feed intact in water for as long as possible.
· Ideal for: Slow-feeding bottom-dwellers like your sandfish, shrimp, and larval feeds.
· Reason: Its thermo-irreversible gel is unmatched for stability. The pellet will erode slowly rather than dissolve.

2. Choose GELATIN for a Balanced, High-Quality Feed

· When: You need good water stability but also value palatability and a softer texture.
· Ideal for: Soft moist feeds for broodstock, or for species that prefer a flexible, protein-enhanced pellet.
· Reason: Provides good binding and contributes digestible protein to the diet.

3. Choose SAGO for Cost-Effectiveness

· When: Minimizing feed cost is the primary goal, and some leaching or pellet breakdown is acceptable.
· Ideal for: Inexpensive feeds for fast-feeding fish like tilapia or carp that consume the pellet quickly.
· Reason: It is an extremely cheap binder that provides basic cohesion. It is not suitable for feeds that must last for hours on the pond bottom.

💡 Application to Your Sandfish Project

For sandfish, which are slow feeders requiring a stable pellet, the choice is clear:

· Agar is the technically superior choice due to its unbeatable water stability.
· Gelatin is a viable, though less stable, alternative that might offer better palatability.
· Sago is not recommended as a primary binder for sandfish. A sago-bound pellet would likely disintegrate too quickly, fouling the water and becoming unavailable to the animals.

Pro Tip: The Blended Approach
A common strategy in feed formulation is to blend binders to balance cost and performance. For example, you could use:

· A base of cheap sago (e.g., 5-10% of the formula) to provide initial cohesion and lower cost.
· A small amount of agar (e.g., 1-2%) to dramatically improve the final water stability.

This approach can often yield a pellet that is much more stable than one with sago alone, at a lower cost than one using only agar.

✅ Conclusion

In short, while sago is the most economical binder, it is functionally inferior to both gelatin and agar for applications requiring high water stability. For your sandfish feed, agar should be your first choice, with gelatin as a second option if palatability is a concern.

Excessive protein is a metabolic burden for aquatic animals. In addition, the quality of protein is determined by the proportion and quantity of amino acid composition, and the amino acid composition of different protein sources has great differences under the same protein level, resulting in great differences in growth effects. For example, fish meal and soybean meal, under the same protein level, the growth effect of fish meal as protein source feed is better than that of soybean meal as protein source feed. Therefore, the quality of feed should be evaluated by integrating protein level, other nutrient level and raw material source.


Optimal ash content for aquaculture feeds
A healthy, well-formulated commercial feed for most aquatic species typically has an ash content between 7% and 12% on a dry matter basis. This range ensures the animals receive necessary minerals without consuming excessive, indigestible material. 
Natural diet of sandfish
Sandfish are deposit feeders that consume organic matter, algae, and small organisms in the sand and sediment. Their digestive systems are adapted to extract nutrition from this natural, low-energy source. While supplementary feeding in aquaculture is common, it should be done with a balanced diet that mimics their natural food sources as closely as possible. Studies show successful hatchery and grow-out diets incorporating powdered algae, seaweed, and probiotic mixtures, not just high-ash mea


#  Factors affecting aquatic feed storage in high temperature season 2021-10-27

In high temperature season, there is a lot of rain and high humidity in the air. If the aquatic compound feed is kept improperly, it is easy to be affected by high temperature and humidity and deteriorate, resulting in losses. So how to store and keep aquatic compound feed scientifically and reasonably in high temperature season is particularly important.


Temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the storage of aquatic feed

Temperature had a great influence on the warehousing and storage of compound feed, because a small amount of moisture and nutrient found in compound feed, for the survival, reproduction provides favorable conditions of bacteria, bacteria enzyme activity under high temperature has a certain degree, bacterial activity enhancement, a large number of breeding, decompose the components in the compound feed rapidly, so that deterioration, and produce a large number of harmful substances, Aquaculture animals eat moldy feed, will not only affect its normal growth, long-term past, toxic and harmful substances in aquaculture animals accumulated in the body, will eventually bring disaster to the health of consumers. When the temperature is lower than 10℃, mold growth is slow, the growth is faster than 30℃, compound feed will deteriorate rapidly, therefore, during high temperature, compound feed should be stored in low temperature ventilation place. The storeroom for storing feed should have heat insulation, light, radiation and other properties, so the top of the storeroom should be insulated, trees should be planted around it for shade, and the walls should be painted white to reduce heat absorption.


Moisture and humidity are two important factors affecting the storage of aquatic feed

Humidity and moisture in the air also play an important role in the storage of compound feed. The moisture of compound feed is generally required to be below 12%. If the humidity in the air is too high, the moisture in compound feed will exceed this proportion, and it will be easy to mildew in summer. Therefore, the storage of compound feed during high temperature should be kept dry, and the packaging should use double bags. In addition to the textile bag packaging outside, there should be a layer of airtight plastic bags inside, so as to prevent the infiltration of moisture in the air. In order to prevent moisture, the compound feed should be stored more than 30 cm away from the ground, and not against the wall. The ground should be covered with straw, rice husk and other moisture-proof materials, and then covered with a layer of straw mat, and finally stacked compound feed is safer.


The above cooling and moisture-proof measures can ensure that the aquatic compound feed will not become mildew during the high temperature in summer.
# Fermented soymail

LiveSeafood, [9/22/25 6:51 AM]
Soybean meal (SBM) is a widely used plant-based protein source in animal feed due to its high protein content and balanced amino acid profile. However, it contains several anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) that can impair nutrient absorption, reduce digestibility, and negatively affect animal health and growth if not properly managed. Below is a detailed list of the major ANFs in soybean meal and methods to eliminate or reduce them, supported by scientific insights and processing techniques.

---

🌱 1. Protease Inhibitors (Trypsin Inhibitors)

· Description: Trypsin inhibitors (e.g., Kunitz and Bowman-Birk inhibitors) block the activity of proteolytic enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin, reducing protein digestibility. This can lead to pancreatic hypertrophy and impaired growth in animals.
· Elimination Methods:
  · Heat Treatment: Moist heat processing (e.g., autoclaving, steaming, or extrusion) at 110°C for 30 minutes effectively inactivates trypsin inhibitors. However, over-heating can reduce amino acid availability (e.g., lysine) due to Maillard reactions.
  · Fermentation: Solid-state fermentation with bacteria (e.g., Bacillus subtilis) or fungi (e.g., Aspergillus oryzae) significantly reduces trypsin inhibitor activity by enzymatic degradation.
  · Enzyme Treatment: Supplemental enzymes (e.g., proteases) can break down inhibitors during feed processing.

---

🌾 2. Oligosaccharides (Raffinose and Stachyose)

· Description: These α-galactosides are indigestible by monogastric animals due to the lack of endogenous α-galactosidase. They cause osmotic diarrhea, flatulence, and reduced nutrient absorption by increasing gut transit time.
· Elimination Methods:
  · Fermentation: Microbial fermentation (e.g., with Bacillus siamensis) hydrolyzes oligosaccharides into digestible sugars.
  · Enzyme Supplementation: Adding exogenous α-galactosidase to feed breaks down these compounds.
  · Extraction and Processing: Ethanol or water extraction removes oligosaccharides in refined soy products (e.g., soy protein concentrate).

---

🧪 3. Antigenic Proteins (Glycinin and β-Conglycinin)

· Description: These storage proteins trigger immune responses in young animals (e.g., piglets and chicks), causing intestinal inflammation, villi atrophy, and increased gut permeability.
· Elimination Methods:
  · Fermentation: Solid-state fermentation with Bacillus subtilis or Aspergillus oryzae degrades antigenic proteins into non-immunogenic peptides.
  · Enzymatic Hydrolysis: Proteases specifically target and break down glycinin and β-conglycinin.
  · Heat Treatment: Partial reduction is possible, but these proteins are heat-stable and require combined approaches (e.g., heat + fermentation).

---

⚖️ 4. Phytic Acid (Phytate)

· Description: Phytate chelates essential minerals (e.g., phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and iron), reducing their bioavailability. It also inhibits protein and vitamin absorption.
· Elimination Methods:
  · Fermentation: Microbial phytase produced during fermentation hydrolyzes phytate into inorganic phosphorus and inositol.
  · Enzyme Supplementation: Adding phytase to feed enhances mineral absorption.
  · Germination and Soaking: Activates endogenous phytases in soybeans, reducing phytate levels.

---

🍃 5. Lectins (Hemagglutinins)

· Description: Lectins bind to intestinal epithelial cells, disrupting nutrient absorption and causing gut damage. They are glycoproteins that agglutinate red blood cells.
· Elimination Methods:
  · Heat Treatment: Moist heat (e.g., boiling for 15 minutes or pressure cooking) completely inactivates lectins.
  · Fermentation: Microbial enzymes degrade lectins during fermentation.

---
🌿 6. Saponins

· Description: Saponins have bitter taste and can reduce feed palatability. They may increase gut permeability and cause hemolytic effects, though they also have potential health benefits (e.g., cholesterol-lowering).
· Elimination Methods:
  · Processing and Extraction: Alcohol extraction removes saponins in refined soy products.

LiveSeafood, [9/22/25 6:51 AM]
· Fermentation: Partial degradation occurs during microbial fermentation.
---

🔥 7. Goitrogens and Rachitogenic Factors

· Description: Goitrogens (e.g., genistin) interfere with thyroid function by inhibiting iodine uptake, while rachitogenic factors impair bone calcification.
· Elimination Methods:
  · Heat Treatment: Reduced by thermal processing, but complete elimination may require combined methods.
  · Fermentation: Microbial degradation reduces these compounds.

---

📊 Summary of Elimination Methods

Anti-Nutritional Factor Effective Reduction Methods Key Considerations

💡 General Processing Strategies for ANF Reduction

1. Heat Processing:
   · Toasting, Extrusion, or Steam Conditioning: Effective for heat-labile ANFs (e.g., trypsin inhibitors and lectins). Must carefully control time and temperature to avoid nutrient damage.
2. Fermentation:
   · Solid-State Fermentation (SSF): Using strains like Bacillus subtilis or Aspergillus oryzae for 48–72 hours significantly reduces multiple ANFs (e.g., oligosaccharides, antigens, and phytate) while enhancing protein quality.
3. Enzymatic Treatment:
   · Supplementation with exogenous enzymes (e.g., phytase, proteases, and α-galactosidase) during processing or in feed.
4. Combined Approaches:
   · Two-Step Fermentation: Using Bacillus subtilis followed by Aspergillus oryzae synergistically reduces ANFs and improves nutritional profiles.
   · Mechanical + Biological Processing: Steam conditioning followed by fermentation enhances ANF degradation.

---

⚠️ Important Considerations

· Species and Age Sensitivity: Young animals (e.g., piglets, chicks, and calves) are more vulnerable to ANFs due to immature digestive systems. Tolerable thresholds exist for each ANF (e.g., trypsin inhibitor activity <3 TIU/mg).
· Nutrient Trade-Offs: Over-processing (e.g., excessive heating) can reduce protein quality and amino acid availability. Fermentation may reduce energy density by consuming carbohydrates.
· Testing and Monitoring: Use indicators like Protein Dispersibility Index (PDI), urease activity, and antigen levels to evaluate SBM quality.

💎 Conclusion

Soybean meal contains multiple anti-nutritional factors that require targeted processing strategies for elimination. Heat treatment, fermentation, and enzymatic processing are highly effective, often used in combination. Fermentation not only reduces ANFs but also enhances protein digestibility and functional properties. Future efforts should focus on optimizing processing conditions to balance ANF reduction with nutrient preservation, ensuring soybean meal's safety and efficacy in animal diets.

Tank Specifications:  
- Round/oval FRP/fiberglass tanks (2–10 tons capacity).  
- Shallow tanks (0.5–1 m depth) for larval rearing.  
- Dark-colored tanks (reduces stress in larvae).  

---

## 2. Broodstock Collection & Conditioning  
### 🔍 Selection Criteria  
- Healthy, disease-free adults (no lesions, active movement).  
- Mature size:  
  - *Holothuria scabra*: ≥20 cm, 300–500 g.  
  - *Holothuria atra*: ≥25 cm, 400–600 g.  

### 🌡 Conditioning Process  
- Acclimatize in tanks (salinity/temperature matching wild habitat).  
- Feed natural diet:  
  - Seaweed powder (30% protein).  
  - Microalgae (*Navicula*, *Chaetoceros*).  
- Thermal shock method for spawning induction:  
  - Raise temp to 32°C for 1 hr, then return to 28°C.  

---

## 3. Spawning & Fertilization  
### ⚡ Induced Spawning Techniques  
1. Temperature Shock (Most common)  
   - Expose to 5°C above ambient for 30–60 mins.  
2. Drying + Sunlight Exposure  
   - Keep broodstock dry for 30 mins, then return to water.  
3. Gonad Stimulation (Experimental)  
   - Serotonin injection (1–2 µg/g body weight).  

### 🥚 Egg Collection & Fertilization  
- Eggs: 100,000–500,000 per female.  
- Sperm: Dilute in seawater before mixing with eggs.  
- Fertilization rate: 70–90% under optimal conditions.  

---

## 4. Larval Rearing (Auricularia → Pentactula)  
| Stage | Duration | Feed | Key Requirements |  
|-------|---------|------|-----------------|  
| Auricularia | 8–12 days | Microalgae (*Chaetoceros*, *Isochrysis*) | Gentle aeration, 28°C |  
| Doliolaria | 3–5 days | Mixed algae + yeast | Reduced light |  
| Pentactula | 5–7 days | Benthic diatoms (*Navicula*) | Settlement substrates |  

Water Quality:  
- pH: 7.8–8.3  
- Ammonia: <0.1 ppm  
- DO: >5 mg/L  

- < 3gr does not need sand Not deposit feeder
- In the wild, juveniles (∼9 mm) settle on seagrass leaves as grazers (Mercier et al., 2000a), and once larger, they migrate onto sand where they become deposit-feeders (Mercier et al., 2000b). 
- need different sand size for optimum grow
- can not replace with silica sand
- Sandfish as Deposit Feeders: Sandfish (Holothuria scabra) are a type of sea cucumber that are deposit feeders. This means they eat organic matter, bacteria, microalgae, and other small organisms that live within the sediment (sand) on the seafloor. The sand itself acts as a substrate and a food source, but the nutritional value comes from the living things within it.
- Sargassum as a Fertilizer: Sargassum is a type of seaweed that is rich in nutrients and organic matter. When added to the sandy substrate in sandfish cultivation tanks or ponds, it acts as an organic fertilizer. This enrichment of the sand boosts the growth of the microalgae, bacteria, and other microorganisms that the sandfish feed on. Studies have shown that adding dried sargassum to the sediment can significantly increase the food abundance, leading to faster growth rates for juvenile sandfish.
- Sargassum as a Direct Feed: In addition to fertilizing the sand, sargassum can also be processed into a direct supplemental feed for sandfish. Researchers have tested different preparations, such as fermented sargassum and powdered sargassum, and found that they can improve the growth and survival of sandfish, especially in early juvenile stages. Fermented sargassum, in particular, has been shown to be very effective.
-  In summary, sargassum doesn't directly fertilize the sand in the way you might think of a plant fertilizer, but it enriches the organic content of the sand, which in turn acts as a "fertilizer" for the living organisms that the sandfish consume. It can also be a direct and valuable feed source for the sandfish themselves. This use of sargassum is a promising development for sustainable aquaculture and a way to utilize
he large influxes of sargassum that can be a nuisance in coastal areas.

Chlorella vulgaris Powder

- Chlorella vulgaris is a type of microalgae known for its high nutritional value, containing protein, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. While live microalgae are a traditional feed for sandfish larvae and early juveniles in hatcheries, powdered forms like chlorella vulgaris are being explored as a cost-effective alternative.

Usage and Benefits
Supplement to Live Algae: Powdered microalgae can supplement or even replace live microalgae, reducing the high cost and labor associated with maintaining live cultures.

Nutritional Profile: Chlorella is rich in essential amino acids and fatty acids, which are crucial for the growth and health of sandfish. Its high protein content makes it an excellent addition to a sandfish diet.

Improved Growth: Studies on other aquatic species have shown that including Chlorella vulgaris in the diet can enhance growth performance and feed efficiency. This is a promising area for further research in sandfish grow-out.

In summary, both sargassum and chlorella vulgaris powder are valuable feed ingredients for sandfish aquaculture. Sargassum is a well-established and highly effective component, especially when fermented, while chlorella powder is a promising, nutrient-rich supplement that can reduce reliance on expensive live feeds.

- Accumulated waste → Ammonia toxicity.  

#### Adjustments:  
| Factor | PL10 | PL15 |  
|--------|------|------|  
| Density | Max 1,500/L | Max 1,000/L |  
| Water Exchange | Not recommended (too stressful) | Partial exchange (10%) after 12 hrs if necessary |  
| O₂ Supply | Oxygen generator or cylinder with regulator | O₂ cylinders + diffuser stones |  
| Sedation | Avoid (too sensitive) | 1–2 ppm clove oil (if >24 hrs) |  
| Monitoring | Check O₂/ammonia every 4 hrs | Check every 6 hrs |  

Survival Tips:  
- Use battery-powered air pumps for backup aeration.  
- Darken transport containers to reduce stress.  

---

### 4. Emergency Recovery Protocol  
If PLs arrive weak or stressed:  
1. Gradual Acclimation:  
   - Float bags for 45–60 mins (not 30 mins).  
   - Drip-acclimate with pond water over 1–2 hrs.  
2. Revival Additives:  
   - PL10: 5 ppm glucose + 1 ppm vitamin B12.  
   - PL15: 3 ppm calcium magnesium + probiotics.  
3. Post-Release Care:  
   - PL10: Hold in nursery tanks (1–2 days) before pond release.  
   - PL15: Can be released directly but avoid feeding for 4–6 hrs.  

---

### Final Recommendations by Condition  
| Transport Type | Best for PL10? | Best for PL15? |  
|---------------|---------------|---------------|  
| Air Freight | Only if <6 hrs | Preferred (more resilient) |  
| Hot Climate | Avoid if possible | Use with cooling packs |  
| Long Road Haul | Not recommended | Yes (with O₂ support) |  

For highest survival:  
- PL10: Keep transport <8 hrs, avoid extreme temps.  
- PL15: More flexible but monitor O₂ closely.

# Vannamei highlist
Highlights
* Clear differences in feeding behaviour between male and female Litopenaeus vannamei.
* Males arrived to the feeding tray(size tray: 60cm x 60cm or 100cm x 100cm) faster and fed for longer than females.
* Females exhibited greater levels of inactivity and more signs of stress than males.
* These behavioural differences are important when choosing mono- vs mixed-sex culture.

## Rotifer
Copepods and rotifers are both types of small aquatic organisms, particularly important in marine and freshwater ecosystems
 as they are a food source for many fish and other invertebrates. However, they belong to 
different groups: copepods are crustaceans (Arthropoda), while rotifers are rotifers (Rotifera).
Copepods are more common in reef tanks, where they contribute to the tank's overall biodiversity
and can be cultured. Rotifers, on the other hand, often require specific conditions
and are typically cultured separately, but they can be a valuable food source, especially for corals. 

Copepods:
Classification: Crustaceans (Arthropoda). 
Habitat: Often associated with live rocks in reef tanks. 
Diet: Primarily feed on phytoplankton, contributing to nutrient cycling in the tank. 
Reef Tank Role: Provide biodiversity, contribute to nutrient cycling, and serve as a food source for certain fish and invertebrates. 
Cultures: Can be cultured in refugiums or other dedicated systems. 

Rotifers:
Classification: Rotifers (Rotifera). 
Habitat: Found in freshwater environments, including lakes, ponds, and even temporary puddles. 
Diet: Primarily feed on algae and other small organisms. 
Reef Tank Role: Serve as a food source, especially for corals and larval fish. 
Cultures: Typically cultured in separate tanks, often using algae or specialized feed.

## [High pressure (30.40 inHg and higher) and Low Pressure (29.60 inHg or lower)  on Ocean about fish](https://wildhunter.ie/blogs/fishing-blog/effects-of-air-pressure-on-fish)

Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere in a specific area, usually measured in millibars (mb) and inches of Mercury (inHg).
 A number of factors can influence the barometric pressure in a given area, including altitude, wind patterns, and temperature.

* **A normal barometric pressure reading is typically between 29.70 inHg and 30.40 inHg**

*  when there’s low barometric pressure and less pressure on a fish’s body, the bladder expands.
   Fish may swim deeper where the water pressure is higher as a way to adjust, becoming less interested in feeding until conditions normalize.

* As we mentioned above, most agree that fishing is slow on both high-pressure and low-pressure days.** If the barometric pressure is above 30.50 inHg or below 29.60 inHg**, you might be better off waiting until the pressure normalizes.

* High Pressure (Good Weather): During periods of high atmospheric pressure, the air pressing down on the water is greater,
  slightly compressing the water. Fish with swim bladders experience a slight reduction in the organ’s volume,
  making them naturally sink a bit. To counteract this, they expend energy adjusting their position in the water column,
  which can make them less active or cautious, influencing their feeding and movement.

* Low Pressure (Bad Weather): When low-pressure systems approach, such as before a storm, the pressure exerted on the water decreases.
  This reduction causes the swim bladder to expand, making fish feel more buoyant. Fish typically respond by moving to deeper waters
  to alleviate the over-buoyancy and find stability, often decreasing their feeding activity in these moments.
  This is why anglers sometimes find it harder to catch fish before a storm.

Polyculture of sea bass using tilapia as forage fish is often practiced.
Growth and survival were higher among sea bass reared with tilapia in the same
compartment than among those reared in ponds with net partition to separate
the larger prey from predator (Triño, unpublished).

## Sebass vs Snapper
- diffferent
- which one taste better

|The table below provides a quick comparison of the availability and cost of snapper and grouper:|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


|Fish|	Availability|	Cost|
|----|--------------|--------|
|Snapper|	Common in Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean|	Higher price due to demand and difficulty of catching|
|Grouper|	Common in Atlantic and Pacific oceans|	More affordable due to abundance and ease of catching|

## Snapper vs Grouper
Both of these species are known for having firm yet moist meat while having the added health benefit of being low in fat. Snapper is slightly sweeter and the meat more delicate, especially when grilled, than Grouper. Most compare its flavor and texture to be similar to that of halibut or sea bass. Grouper on the other hand is milder or more subtle in flavor making it perfect for absorbing either dressings or marinades

## hardshell vs softshell  (or just molting shrimp) result in high and low salinity shirmp culture
Hard shell lobsters also have less water weight, while soft
shell lobsters contain more water. This difference in yield is
reflected in the lower pricing of soft shell lobsters. For comparison, the average
yield for hard shells is roughly 20% to 28% meat, while soft shells contain around 15% to
20% meat. 5 Jun 2018

Para nelayan di Riau, seperti Indragiri Hilir,  belakangan ini ‘berburu’ mendapatkan ikan tirusan atau tirus karena harga yang selangit. Ikan dengan nama latin  Otolithoides pama, termasuk famili sciaenidae,  harga per ekor bisa mencapai puluhan juta rupiah.
Yang bernilai tinggi dari ikan tirusan adalah gelembung (limpanya). Pembeli atau pengepul biasa mengupah orang yang ahli lagi untuk membelah perut ikan ini.

Hasil pencatatan BPPMHKP Pekanbaru, pengiriman gelembung ikan sepanjang 2019-2023 mencapai 1.204 kali atau 36.895 kilogram. Sumbernya dari enam daerah penghasil ikan di
1. Tembilahan,
2. Bengkalis, 
3. Dumai,
4. Selat Panjang, 
5. Pekanbaru dan 
6. Panipahan.

Setidaknya ada enam pengirim utama mendominasi dalam perdagangan gelembung ikan di Riau.

Data ini tidak spesifik menyebut jenis ikan penghasil gelembung renang itu. Selain tirusan, gelembung yang biasa diperdagangkan juga produk turunan dari ikan malong (Muraenesox cinereus).

# [Ikan Malong (Muraenesox cinereus)](https://indiabiodiversity.org/species/show/232787)
Malong ( Muraenesox cinereus )adalah spesies ikan Sidat dalam keluarga pike conger, Muraenesocidae .
 Mereka terutama hidup di dasar lunak di perairan laut dan air payau hingga kedalaman 800 m (2.600 ft), tapi bisa masuk ke air tawar.

Grow-out operations in central Vietnam are capable of producing market-size sandfish (350–400 g), from 2–5 g juveniles, after approximately 12 months in earthen pond-based culture.
 However, the onset of the wet season in Vietnam (typically from May to early November) and resulting reduction in the salinity of culture water,
 may impact productivity through reduced growth rates and survival (Mills et al., 2012).
 Vietnamese farmers have consequently developed an ‘advanced nursery’ phase, where 2–5 g juveniles are cultured at high density in ponds with organic matter-rich sediment (>50,000 ind./ha compared
 to ∼10,000 ind./ha which is the standard grow-out density), until they reach a size of ca. 50 g.
 This permits ‘short-cropping’ during the grow-out phase, because when larger juveniles are grown out, they can reach the target harvest weight of 350–400 g within 7–9 months
 and experience higher rates of survival (Mills et al., 2012).

The goal of this study was therefore to undertake a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of supplemental feeding to support short-cropping culture of sandfish in Vietnam by:

1. evaluating the growth and survival performance of sandfish juveniles offered two different types of locally-sourced seaweed-based supplemental feeds (Sargassum sp. and Gracilaria verrucosa) 
processed by both fermentation and pulverisation;

2.  determining an optimal stocking density for juveniles offered supplemental feeding; and 

3. applying the best-performing supplemental feed, determined from (1) during large-scale earthen-pond culture to assess the feasibility of commercial-scale short cropping.

Supplemental feed preparation
===
Supplemental feeds were prepared from commercially available wild-sourced seaweed collected from coastal regions in Khánh Hòa Province, Vietnam, which is readily available in dried form (Hong and Ha, 2022). Fresh seaweed is first cleaned at the collection site using seawater to remove sand, debris, epiphytic growths and other extraneous matter attached to thalli and, prior to sun-drying, was rinsed with freshwater to remove salt residue. Both species of dried seaweed were powdered to a particle size of 350–450 µm using a high-speed dry grinding machine (2 kg capacity; 4000 W; model RRH2000A; Riri Hong Ltd) to produce the pulverised supplemental feeds. The fermented diets were prepared in batches as required. To prepare a single batch of fermented feed, 10 kg of dried seaweed powder was mixed with 2.5 g of a commercially-available livestock feed probiotic mixture (BIO-MEN animal feed brewing yeast/Men ủ thức ăn chăn nuôi BIO-MEN manufactured by Vườn Sinh Thái/Eco Garden, Vietnam), and 10 L of freshwater. The probiotic mixture comprised Saccharomyces boulardii (at a concentration of 1010-1014 Colony Forming Units; CFU), Lactobacillus acidophilus (1010 CFU) and Bacillus subtilis (1010 CFU) per g, respectively. This product had a maximum moisture content of 10%, sand/grit content of 2% and used corn flour and rice bran as the probiotic carrier agents (https://vuonsinhthai.com.vn/men-u-vi-sinh-thao-duoc-u-chin-thuc-an-chan-nuoi.html

 # use of oyster shell 
 The easiest way to avoid this problem is to only use aged shell in your setting tanks. Every shell used in the system should be aged
at least a full year out in the open where it will be is exposed to weather and other factors that will remove the organic material from the shells. Once this ageing process
is completed, it is best if the shells are washed or cleaned to remove as much dirt and small shell fragments from the cultch as possible. When you have clean cultch material
 it is ready to be containerized for use in your setting system.
 
 ## Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) 
 is a non-crystalline form of calcium carbonate, and it is composed of aggregated nano-size primary particles. 
 Here, we evaluated its anti-cancer effect postulated relative to its buffering capabilities in lung cancer.
 
 # Aeration 
 The most common approach is to use aeration. Most setting tanks are fairly shallow (6 feet deep or less) and this lends itself to aeration by rotary blower. Rotary blowers are used 
 because they provide high volumes of air at low pressure. They are more efficient than compressors and do not introduce oil into the system. 
Blowers should be sized to provide a gentle rolling movement throughout the entire setting tank. When installing aeration, make sure that water from the setting tanks is 
not allowed by gravity to flow backwards into the blower when the blower is off.
The easiest ways to do this are either to install the blower above the highest water level of the setting tanks or to add a section of pipe that extends above the high water mark.
Getting air from the blower to the tanks is usually done through PVC pipes. Pipes
should be sized according to the volume of the setting tanks but, with smaller tanks
capable of holding 200-300 shell bags, 1.5 to 2 inch inside diameter pipes are
sufficient. Larger tanks will require larger diameter aeration lines. Blowers used in
remote setting do not create much pressure and therefore the use of larger pipe is
required. Pipes should be drilled with 3/8” holes about every 8 to 12 inches along
the length of the pipe to provide adequate aeration. Aeration pipes should be spaced
apart to allow a gentle flow to be created when the air is on. For example, a 12 foot
diameter tank with 3 or 4 pipes spaced at the bottom of the tank provides sufficient
aeration for good settlement to occur.

It is important that aeration pipes used inside the tanks NOT be glued together. These pipes will fill with sediment, have oyster larvae settle on them, and other things that
require them to be cleaned inside and out. In fact, each time a setting tank is broken down and reloaded with cultch, the air pipes should
be taken apart and thoroughly cleaned inside and out. This can be done with a brush on a
rope and fresh water, another good reason to use larger diameter piping. Care should be  taken to remove ALL newly settled oyster spat
from the pipes and any other surface in the setting tank. If the tanks are re-used these spat will continue to grow. These spat
are voracious feeders and will compete with the next batch of larval oysters for the food in the tank and as they get bigger will provide substrate for oysters to settle on 

# Instant algae
Instant algae is your easy solution for replacing or supplementing live microalgae in commercial fish, shrimp, shellfish and ornamental hatcheries, universities and research centers. It is real marine microalgae, grown under laboratory conditions and concentrated for easy storage and long life. Instant algae is not alive and cannot be used as starter cultures – it is an inexpensive bulk feed.

Nannochloropsis

These are small green algaes that are extensively used in the aquaculture industry for growing small zooplankton such as rotifers and for greenwater. They are also used in reef tanks for feeding corals and other filter feeders. It is 3600 times as dense as cultured algae, so 1 liter replaces almost 4 metric tons of live algae! Available in 1-quart & 1-pint bottles, and 1-liter bags. Nannochloropsis is the single best food for growing rotifers. It has a very high EPA level and can be frozen for long term storage. It also works well for greenwater.

Shellfish hatcheries: works very well with mussels. It has not been traditionally used with oysters and clams, however a study currently being done at a university in Los Angeles indicates that it can work as well or better than Isochrysis and Pavlova with larvae and post set. Storage: instant algae nannochloropsis can be stored in a refrigerator for 3 months (best if stored at -1° to 3°C) or it can be frozen for longer shelf life (2+ years). When frozen, the algae will “hard-freeze” like ice.

Pavlova

Pavlova is a small golden/brown flagellate that is very similar to Isochrysis. It has a very high DHA profile and is excellent for enriching rotifers and other zooplankton. It is very difficult to develop the Pavlova, that is the reason why it is not produced by many incubation facilities. Pavlova is similar in nutritional profile to Isochrysis, however it has a more sophisticated sterol composition so it is very popular with cold water fish hatcheries (such as cod) for enriching rotifers.

Pavlova has both a high DHA and EPA profile so its good for enriching zooplankton. We have received very good reports on larval survival from hatcheries that use it to enrich brine shrimp. Pavlova works very well for oysters, clams, mussels and scallops. It is also used to increase the DHA/EPA levels in broodstock.

Isochrysis

Isochrysis is a small golden/brown flagellate that is very commonly used in the aquaculture industry. It is high in DHA and often used to enrich zooplankton such as rotifers or Artemia. Used for DHA enrichment of rotifers.

It is also a good size for feeding brine shrimp and copepods. Isochrysis is the most commonly used algae for oysters, clams, mussels and scallops.

Tetraselmis

Tetraselmis is a large green flagellate with a very high lipid level. It also contains natural amino acids that stimulate feeding in marine animals. It is an excellent feed for larval shrimp. Used in conjunction with Nannochloropsis for producing rotifers.

It is also a good size for feeding brine shrimp. A standard feed for oysters, clams, mussels and scallops.

Rotifer Diet HD

Rotifer Diet™ HD is a marine microalgae feed product for producing high quality, high density, low cost rotifers. Rotifer Diet HD is a combination of the microalgae species Nannochloropsis & Tetraselmis and results in a 20% increase in rotifer volume over pure Nannochloropsis.

It is a 100% complete feeding solution, needing no other feed additives to produce dense cultures. Rotifer Diet HD was specifically designed for high density rotifer systems, but also works exceptionally well in low density and batch cultures.

Thalassiosira weissflogii

Thalassiosira weissflogii is a large diatom (6-20μm x 8-15μm) that is used in the shrimp and shellfish larviculture industry. This algae is considered by several hatcheries to be the single best algae for larval shrimp. The large cell size (16 times the biomass of Chaetoceros and 3 times the biomass of Tetraselmis) extends the algae feeding period until the end of the PL stage. During the winter, this algae is about 15 microns, but shrinks to about 5 microns during the summer.

The color of TW varies from brown to green to yellow, depending on the amount of chlorophyll in the culture. This color change does not in any way affect the quality of the algae. Good for feeding copepods and brine shrimp. Due to its large size, TW is a very good feed for post-set (200 microns and larger) oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, and for broodstock conditioning.

Shellfish Diet

Shellfish diet is a mix of five marine microalgae that all have demonstrated success with a variety of shellfish including oysters, clams, mussels and scallops. A mixed diet provides a much better nutritional profile for all types of shellfish, increasing both growth rates and survival. Shellfish diet can be used with preset larvae all the way up through broodstock and will typically perform as well as algae so it can be used as a complete live algae replacement. 1/4 of Shellfish diet will replace the equivalent to 1800 liters of dense algae culture. This product is available in plastic bottles of 1/4, 1-pint and 1-gallon. The quantity of cells changes depending on the time of the year, but is approximately 2 billions of cells per ml.

Spirulina powder, a type of blue-green algae, is often cultivated in both freshwater and seawater environments. Seawater can be a viable and even advantageous medium for growing spirulina, particularly for reducing the need for additional nutrients. However, spirulina grown in seawater may have a higher iodine content and require careful drying processes to maintain qualit.

Seawater can be a cost-effective and potentially more sustainable medium for spirulina cultivation, especially when supplemented with nutrients. Studies have shown that spirulina can thrive in seawater, and in some cases, even exhibit increased carbohydrate production and biomass concentration compared to freshwater cultures. 

The quality of spirulina, regardless of the cultivation medium, depends on factors like the source of the water, the cultivation methods, and the drying process. Spirulina harvested from clean sources and properly dried is essential for ensuring a high-quality product. 


A  large-scale  cultivation  experiment  demonstrated  that  Spirulina  platensis,  strain  SCS,  can  be  adapted  togrow  in  seawater  enriched  with  a  commercial  compound  fertilizer  (N: Ρ: Κ  =  12:12:12),  NaHCO3 andFeSO4.  To  avoid  excess  precipitation,  a  compound  fertilizer, which  contained  phosphate,  was  supplied  bydiffusion  through  a tubular  dialysis membrane  and  a small amount  of NaHCO3 was added. The average yieldof  biomass  in  84 days  of consecutive  production  was  10.3 g (dry  weight) m~2 day"1. The  protein and  aminoacids  contents  in  the  product  were  66.6%  and  62.2%  respectively.  We have shown  that  outdoor cultivationof  Spirulina  in seawater has potential for industrial production  without involving valuable farm land, employingless  expensive culture  medium which  can  be  recycled  and  giving higher  yield  and  higher quality products



Biochemical Changes
One of the most interesting side effects of culturing spirulina in seawater is that the carbohydrate content of it skyrockets while the protein content drops significantly.

Spirulina harvesting 
---
involves separating the algae from its liquid growth medium. This is typically done through filtration or centrifugation, followed by drying to produce a powder or flakes. The harvested spirulina can then be used as a food supplement or in other application
